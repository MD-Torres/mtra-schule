# Introduction

Effective communication in palliative care is crucial, particularly when discussing end-of-life care.

Research highlights that attitudes towards these sensitive conversations among both the public and healthcare professionals are positive and both view this topic as important.

A systematic review by Sharp et al. [@SharpEtAl2013] showed that the majority of older individuals (61%-91%) expressed a desire to discuss their end-of-life care, with many feeling comfortable or even enthusiastic about these conversations. Healthcare professionals generally also recognized the importance of these discussions, and most doctors (91%-97%) believed they are essential when dealing with severe chronic or terminal illnesses.

Despite these positive attitudes, actual end-of-life care discussions remain scarce.

Gamble et al. [@GambleEtAl1991] for example showed that while 81% of patients wanted to talk about end-of-life care with their physicians, only 11% had done so, and that these conversations were usually initiated by the patients themselves. Similarly, a 2021 Canadian poll revealed that although 59% of Canadians had discussed their care wishes with family, only 7% had communicated these preferences to a healthcare provider.

These findings underscore the need for more proactive and widespread communication about end-of-life care in palliative settings to ensure that patient preferences are understood and respected.

The significance of early integration into palliative care is well-established, with a considerable portion of the benefits attributed to effective communication. 
For example, Yoong et al. [@YoongEtAl2013] found that addressing symptoms and coping were the most prevalent components of palliative care clinic visits, which focused on building relationships and rapport with patients and their families and on understanding the illness, including prognostic awareness. 

However, healthcare professionals trained in communication should not use communication tools indiscriminately. 
This was demonstrated in a randomised study conducted by Curtis et al.[@CurtisEtAl2013] 
They conducted a workshop consisting of eight 4-hour sessions led by a physician and a nurse. This workshop was designed to improve communication skills for oncology fellows and was associated with the acquisition of new skills in both: 

- delivering bad news
- responding to emotions

However, there was no significant change in ratings of quality of care or quality of end-of-life care as assessed by patients, family, or other clinicians.  

This finding suggests that improvements in communication skills observed in a controlled, standardized setting may not necessarily translate to enhancements in real-world clinical practice.

Conversely, quality of care significantly improved among patients who rated their health status as “poor,” underscoring the importance of carefully selecting appropriate patients before delivering specialist palliative care.

Moreover, an increase in patients’ depressive symptoms associated with the intervention was observed, indicating that awareness of prognosis may trigger negative experiences if not properly addressed by an expert.

In this regard data pertaining comunication in specialist palliative care is lacking, however because of certain similarities a comparison with bereavement counselling might be helpful:

Negative side effects of bereavement counselling are known to exist and are currently being researched. This is logical since bereavement counselling is a psychosocial intervention, sharing characteristics with psychotherapy, such as the need to establish a therapeutic alliance that requires trust and openness from the client.

Negative effects can either be:
- unintended detrimental consequences of properly applied interventions (i.e. side effects)
- The result from inappropriately applied interventions, such as unethical behavior and malpractice. [@TelaarEtAl2023]

Examples of these negative effects can be found in a study by Moritz et al. [@MoritzEtAl2019] involving individuals with depression. 
While positive effects were reported by virtually all patients (95.6%), approximately half of them (52.6%) also reported experiencing at least one adverse event.

These considerations highlight the necessity for a careful approach to using specialist palliative care communication tools. It is crucial to ensure that these tools are targeted toward those who will benefit the most while avoiding potential adverse effects for others.

This was demonstrated in a study conducted by Currier et al.[@CurrierEtAl2008], where interventions for bereaved persons were differentiated as follows:

- Universal
- Selective
- Indicated

Universal interventions targeted anyone who suffered bereavement, regardless of pre-intervention functioning.

Selective interventions were aimed at particular groups of bereaved individuals who faced a heightened risk of experiencing distress symptoms, such as those who lost a child to a violent death.

Lastly, indicated interventions were restricted to those manifesting clinically significant difficulties adapting to loss.

In this study, interventions targeting universal populations and higher-risk grievers failed to produce good outcomes. Conversely, the effect sizes of the indicated interventions compared favorably with the successes shown for psychotherapy in general.

Further more it is important to underscore that losing a loved one to death (or dying) is an inherent part of human life and that only about 7% of bereaved older adults will develop the mental health condition known as complicated grief. [@ShearEtAl2013]

In summary, while effective communication in palliative care is essential, it's indiscriminate application could lead to negative side effects, e.g. depression. Additionally, physicians often do not need to employ specialist palliative care communication skills and tools with patients at the end of life to provide adequate care.

Therefore, end-of-life communication should prioritize being approachable, honest, warm, and authentic over technical skills and communication tools. Such an approach may lead to better therapeutic relationships and more positive outcomes for patients and their relatives at the end of life.
