# Introduction


Technical skills are less important than coming across as approachable, honest, warm and confident.

Some important factors to be taken into account are: 
- Comfort
- Language
- Question style
- Listening / use of silence
- Reflection
- Summarising



Losing a loved one to death is an inherent part of human life. About 7% of bereaved older adults, however, will develop the mental health condition of Complicated Grief (CG). [@ShearEtAl2013]

Negative side effects of bereavement counselling are known to exist in psychotherapy and are the subject of current research

Since bereavement counselling is a psychosocial intervention and therefore shares some characteristics with psychotherapy (e.g., the establishment of a therapeutic alliance requiring trust and openness from the client), it is reasonable to assume that negative effects could occur also in bereavement counselling.

Negative effects can either be unintended detrimental consequences of properly applied interventions (side effects) or result from inappropriate applied interventions, e.g., unethical behavior and malpractice.[@TelaarEtAl2023]

For example in a Study of depression in a population of individuals with depression the positive and negative effects of psychotherapy effects were quantified. Positive effects were reported by virtually all patients (95.6%). 
At the same time, approximately half of them reported at least one adverse event (52.6%). Among these, side effects (38.5%) and malpractice (26.7%) were significantly more prevalent than unethical conduct (8.1%). [@MoritzEtAl2019]

That is why it is of outmost importance to choose patients fit for beraavement counselling whisley. 
For example, at least some individuals experiencing prolonged depression during bereavement may have been depressed prior to the loss and thus may be more accurately viewed as suffering from chronic depression rather than chronic grief.[@BonannoEtAl2004]

However complicated grief constitutes a distinct psychopathological diagnostic entity distinct from eg posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder. Complicated grief is characterized by a unique pattern of symptoms following bereavement that are typically slow to resolve and can persist for years if left untreated.  

Using prospective longitudinal data on an older sample beginning prior to the death of a spouse, Bonanno et al. [@BonannoEtAl2002] distinguished 5 unique trajectories of bereavement outcome: 

- common grief 
- chronic grief 
- chronic depression 
- depression followed by improvement
- resilience.

Interventions are separated in

- Universal 
- Selective
- Indicated

Universal interventions target anyone who suffers bereavement and do not distinguish on the basis of death-related risk factors or pre-intervention functioning.

Although selective interventions do not focus on highly distressed grievers per se, they are geared toward particular groups of bereaved individuals who face a heightened risk of experiencing distress symptoms, such as those who lose a child to a violent death.

Lastly, there is a third group of indicated interventions (e.g., Wagner, Knaevelsrud, & Maercker, 2006) that restrict selection to those manifesting problems adapting to loss, which can include symptoms of an established psychiatric disorder (e.g., major depression; Reynolds et al., 1999) or other clinically significant difficulties (e.g., loss-related intrusions, anxiety, and guilt feeling) 

In this study Interventions targeting universal populations and higher risk grievers failed to produce good outcomes. Conversely, when there were specific difficulties adapting to loss, effect sizes compared favorably with the successes shown for psychotherapy in general were observed.[@StroebeEtAl2005]
