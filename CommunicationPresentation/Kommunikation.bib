  abstract = {PURPOSE: Treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy provides a modest survival advantage over supportive care alone in advanced non--small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To determine whether a new agent, paclitaxel, would further improve survival in NSCLC, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group conducted a randomized trial comparing paclitaxel plus cisplatin to a standard chemotherapy regimen consisting of cisplatin and etoposide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out by a multi-institutional cooperative group in chemotherapy-naive stage IIIB to IV NSCLC patients randomized to receive paclitaxel plus cisplatin or etoposide plus cisplatin. Paclitaxel was administered at two different dose levels (135 mg/m2 and 250 mg/m2), and etoposide was given at a dose of 100 mg/m2 daily on days 1 to 3. Each regimen was repeated every 21 days and each included cisplatin (75 mg/m2). RESULTS: The characteristics of the 599 patients were well-balanced across the three treatment groups. Superior survival was observed with the combined paclitaxel regimens (median survival time, 9.9 months; 1-year survival rate, 38.9\%) compared with etoposide plus cisplatin (median survival time, 7.6 months; 1-year survival rate, 31.8\%; P = .048). Comparing survival for the two dose levels of paclitaxel revealed no significant difference. The median survival duration for the stage IIIB subgroup was 7.9 months for etoposide plus cisplatin patients versus 13.1 months for all paclitaxel patients (P = .152). For the stage IV subgroup, the median survival time for etoposide plus cisplatin was 7.6 months compared with 8.9 months for paclitaxel (P = .246). With the exceptions of increased granulocytopenia on the low-dose paclitaxel regimen and increased myalgias, neurotoxicity, and, possibly, increased treatment-related cardiac events with high-dose paclitaxel, toxicity was similar across all three arms. Quality of life (QOL) declined significantly over the 6 months. However, QOL scores were not significantly different among the regimens. CONCLUSION: As a result of these observations, paclitaxel (135 mg/m2) combined with cisplatin has replaced etoposide plus cisplatin as the reference regimen in our recently completed phase III trial.},

The objective of this study was to assess knowledge of diagnosis and goals of treatment among patients with advanced cancer, and also to assess whether this knowledge changed over time. A cohort of 181 subjects with advanced cancer receiving palliative therapies were interviewed at entry and again 12 weeks later. Knowledge of disease diagnosis, treatment intent, and the main sources of information were determined. Twenty per cent of subjects considered their illness to be non-life threatening, and 46\% correctly perceived treatment intent as non-curative; 29\% believed the intent of treatment was cure. Subjects resident in rural areas were more likely to misunderstand the goal of their treatment. Treatment modality was significantly associated with knowledge of treatment intent, and subjects in the last 6 months of life had clearer understanding that treatment intent was non-curative. Many patients with advanced cancer do not understand the goals of treatment. Excessive optimism may lead to impaired decision making. Further empirical research into information transfer and predictors of accurate patient understanding would assist clinicians in their discussions of prognosis and potential treatment outcomes with patients.},

  abstract = {ObjectivesIn palliative care, effective communication is essential to adequately meet the needs and preferences of patients and their relatives. Effective communication includes exchanging information, facilitates shared decision-making, and promotes an empathic care relationship. We explored the perspectives of patients with an advanced illness and their relatives on effective communication with health-care professionals.MethodsA systematic review was conducted. We searched Embase, Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane for original empirical studies published between January 1, 2015 and March 4, 2021.ResultsIn total, 56 articles on 53 unique studies were included. We found 7 themes that from the perspectives of patients and relatives contribute to effective communication: (1) open and honest information. However, this open and honest communication can also trigger anxiety, stress, and existential disruption. Patients and relatives also indicated that they preferred (2) health-care professionals aligning to the patient's and relative's process of uptake and coping with information; (3) empathy; (4) clear and understandable language; (5) leaving room for positive coping strategies, (6) committed health-care professionals taking responsibility; and (7) recognition of relatives in their role as caregiver. Most studies in this review concerned communication with physicians in a hospital setting.Significance of resultsMost patients and relatives appreciate health-care professionals to not only pay attention to strictly medical issues but also to who they are as a person and the process they are going through. More research is needed on effective communication by nurses, in nonhospital settings and on communication by health-care professionals specialized in palliative care.},

  abstract = {Background: As patients' accurate understanding of their prognosis is essential for informed end-of-life planning, identifying associated factors is important. Objective: We examine if receiving palliative chemotherapy or radiation, and the perception of those treatments as curative or noncurative, is associated with prognostic understanding. Design: Cross-sectional analyses from a multisite, observational study. Setting/Subjects: Patients with advanced cancers refractory to at least one chemotherapy regimen (N\,=\,334). Measurements: In structured interviews, patients reported whether they were receiving chemotherapy or radiation, and whether its intent was curative or not. Their responses were categorized into three groups: patients not receiving chemotherapy/radiation (no cancer treatment group); patients receiving chemotherapy/radiation and misperceiving it as curative (treatment misperception group); and patients receiving chemotherapy/radiation and accurately perceiving it as noncurative (accurate treatment perception group). Patients also reported on various aspects of their prognostic understanding (e.g., life expectancy). Results: Eighty-six percent of the sample was receiving chemotherapy or radiation; of those, 16.7\% reported the purpose of treatment to be curative. The no-treatment group had higher prognostic understanding scores compared with the treatment misperception group (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\,=\,5.00, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). However, the accurate treatment perception group had the highest prognostic understanding scores in comparison to the no-treatment group (AOR\,=\,2.04, p\,{$<$}\,0.05) and the treatment misperception group (AOR\,=\,10.19, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Conclusions: Depending on patient perceptions of curative intent, receipt of palliative chemotherapy or radiation is associated with better or worse prognostic understanding. Research should examine if enhancing patients' understanding of treatment intent can improve accurate prognostic expectations.},

  abstract = {Early ambulatory palliative care (PC) is an emerging practice, and its key elements have not been defined. We conducted a qualitative analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial that demonstrated improved quality of life, mood, and survival in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic non--small cell lung cancer who received early PC integrated with standard oncologic care vs standard oncologic care alone. Our objectives were to (1) identify key elements of early PC clinic visits, (2) explore the timing of key elements, and (3) compare the content of PC and oncologic visit notes at the critical time points of clinical deterioration and radiographic disease progression.We randomly selected 20 patients who received early PC and survived within 4 periods: less than 3 months (n~=~5), 3 to 6 months (n~=~5), 6 to 12 months (n~=~5), and 12 to 24 months (n~=~5). We performed content analysis on PC and oncologic visit notes from the electronic health records of these patients.Addressing symptoms and coping were the most prevalent components of the PC clinic visits. Initial visits focused on building relationships and rapport with patients and their families and on illness understanding, including prognostic awareness. Discussions about resuscitation preferences and hospice predominantly occurred during later visits. Comparing PC and oncologic care visits around critical time points, both included discussions about symptoms and illness status; however, PC visits emphasized psychosocial elements, such as coping, whereas oncologic care visits focused on cancer treatment and management of medical complications.Early PC clinic visits emphasize managing symptoms, strengthening coping, and cultivating illness understanding and prognostic awareness in a responsive and time-sensitive model. During critical clinical time points, PC and oncologic care visits have distinct features that suggest a key role for PC involvement and enable oncologists to focus on cancer treatment and managing medical complications.},
