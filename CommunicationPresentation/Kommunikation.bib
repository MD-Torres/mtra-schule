  abstract = {This study identifies and describes the profiles of bereavement risk and support needs of a community sample in Australia and tests the fit of the data with the three-tiered public health model for bereavement support. Family members who were bereaved 6--24 months prior to the survey and who were clients of four funeral providers participated (May-July 2013). A postal survey was used to collect information about bereaved people's experience of caring and perceived satisfaction with any bereavement support provided. The questionnaire included a validated risk assessment screening measure for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PG-13). A total of 678 bereaved people responded. The model predicted that 60\% of the sample would be low risk, 30\% moderate risk, and 10\% high risk. Actual figures were very close at 58.4\%, 35.2\% and 6.4\% respectively. The analysis of the demographic characteristics, experience and impact of caring and bereavement, and satisfaction with support received from a variety of sources revealed differential experiences and needs that align with the expectation of low, moderate, and high bereavement support need, as articulated in the public health model. This is the first empirical test of the public health model of bereavement support. As there is a lack of clear evidence to guide development and allocation of bereavement support programs, the findings have the potential to inform the ability of services, community organizations and informal networks to prioritize care according to each level of bereavement need. This is essential to achieve cost-effective and equitable resource allocation.},

The key idea of this hypothesis is that decision making is a process that is influenced by marker signals that arise in bioregulatory processes, including those that express themselves in emotions and feelings. This influence can occur at multiple levels of operation, some of which occur consciously and some of which occur non-consciously. Here we review studies that confirm various predictions from the hypothesis. The orbitofrontal cortex represents one critical structure in a neural system subserving decision making. Decision making is not mediated by the orbitofrontal cortex alone, but arises from large-scale systems that include other cortical and subcortical components. Such structures include the amygdala, the somatosensory/insular cortices and the peripheral nervous system. Here we focus only on the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in decision making and emotional processing, and the relationship between emotion, decision making and other cognitive functions of the frontal lobe, namely working memory.},

  abstract = {An understanding of patients' care goals in the context of a serious illness is an essential element of high-quality care, allowing clinicians to align the care provided with what is most important to the patient. Early discussions about goals of care are associated with better quality of life, reduced use of nonbeneficial medical care near death, enhanced goal-consistent care, positive family outcomes, and reduced costs. Existing evidence does not support the commonly held belief that communication about end-of-life issues increases patient distress. However, conversations about care goals are often conducted by physicians who do not know the patient, do not routinely address patients' nonmedical goals, and often fail to provide patients with sufficient information about prognosis to allow appropriate decisions; in addition, they tend to occur so late in the patient's illness that their impact on care processes is reduced. This article (1) reviews the evidence and describes best practices in conversations about serious illness care goals and (2) offers practical advice for clinicians and health care systems about developing a systematic approach to quality and timing of such communication to assure that each patient has a personalized serious illness care plan. Best practices in discussing goals of care include the following: sharing prognostic information, eliciting decision-making preferences, understanding fears and goals, exploring views on trade-offs and impaired function, and wishes for family involvement. Several interventions hold promise in systematizing conversations with patients about serious illness care goals: better education of physicians; systems to identify and trigger early discussions for appropriate patients; patient and family education; structured formats to guide discussions; dedicated, structured sections in the electronic health record for recording information; and continuous measurement. We conclude that communication about serious illness care goals is an intervention that should be systematically integrated into our clinical care structures and processes.},

Specific hypotheses were tested regarding differences in coping, meaning making, context, and representations of the lost relationship. Results suggest that chronic grief stems from the upheaval surrounding the loss of a healthy spouse, whereas chronic depression results from more enduring emotional difficulties that are exacerbated by the loss. Both the resilient and the depressed-improved groups showed remarkably healthy profiles and relatively little evidence of either struggling with or denying/avoiding the loss.

According to DSM-IV, bereavement is a stressor event that warrants a clinical diagnosis only in extreme cases when other DSM categories of psychopathology (e.g., Major Depression) are evident. In contrast, bereavement theorists have proposed a number of different types of abnormal grief reactions, including those in which grief is masked or delayed. In this article, we review empirical evidence on the longitudinal course, phenomenological features, and possible diagnostic relevance of grief reactions. This evidence was generally consistent with the DSM-IV's view of bereavement and provided little support for more complicated taxonomies. Most bereaved individuals showed moderate disruptions in functioning during the first year after a loss, while more chronic symptoms were evidenced by a relatively small minority. Further, those individuals showing chronic grief reactions can be relatively easily accommodated by existing diagnostic categories. Finally, we found no evidence to support the proposed delayed grief category. We close by suggesting directions for subsequent research.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy provides a modest survival advantage over supportive care alone in advanced non--small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To determine whether a new agent, paclitaxel, would further improve survival in NSCLC, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group conducted a randomized trial comparing paclitaxel plus cisplatin to a standard chemotherapy regimen consisting of cisplatin and etoposide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out by a multi-institutional cooperative group in chemotherapy-naive stage IIIB to IV NSCLC patients randomized to receive paclitaxel plus cisplatin or etoposide plus cisplatin. Paclitaxel was administered at two different dose levels (135 mg/m2 and 250 mg/m2), and etoposide was given at a dose of 100 mg/m2 daily on days 1 to 3. Each regimen was repeated every 21 days and each included cisplatin (75 mg/m2). RESULTS: The characteristics of the 599 patients were well-balanced across the three treatment groups. Superior survival was observed with the combined paclitaxel regimens (median survival time, 9.9 months; 1-year survival rate, 38.9\%) compared with etoposide plus cisplatin (median survival time, 7.6 months; 1-year survival rate, 31.8\%; P = .048). Comparing survival for the two dose levels of paclitaxel revealed no significant difference. The median survival duration for the stage IIIB subgroup was 7.9 months for etoposide plus cisplatin patients versus 13.1 months for all paclitaxel patients (P = .152). For the stage IV subgroup, the median survival time for etoposide plus cisplatin was 7.6 months compared with 8.9 months for paclitaxel (P = .246). With the exceptions of increased granulocytopenia on the low-dose paclitaxel regimen and increased myalgias, neurotoxicity, and, possibly, increased treatment-related cardiac events with high-dose paclitaxel, toxicity was similar across all three arms. Quality of life (QOL) declined significantly over the 6 months. However, QOL scores were not significantly different among the regimens. CONCLUSION: As a result of these observations, paclitaxel (135 mg/m2) combined with cisplatin has replaced etoposide plus cisplatin as the reference regimen in our recently completed phase III trial.},

We used data from Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study 5592 (E5592), a randomized trial comparing three chemotherapeutic regimens in 599 advanced NSCLC patients. Patients completed the FACT-L at baseline (pretreatment), 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months. Comparing across baseline performance status (0 vs. 1), prior weight loss ({$<$}5\% vs. {$>$} or = 5\%), and primary disease symptoms ({$<$} or = 1 vs. {$>$}1), LCS and TOI score differences ranged from 2.4 to 3.6 and 6.5 to 9.2, respectively (all Ps {$<$}.001). Mean improvement in LCS score from baseline to 12 weeks was 2.4 points in patients who had responded to treatment versus 0.0 points in patients who had progressive disease. Twelve-week LCS change scores for patients progressing early were 3.1 points worse than those of patients progressing later (mean = -1.2 vs.1.9, respectively). Similarly, the average TOI change score from baseline to 12 weeks was -6.1 for patients who had progressive disease versus -0.8 points for patients who had responded to treatment. Twelve-week TOI change scores for patients progressing early (mean = -8.1) were 5.7 points worse than those of patients progressing later (mean = -8.1 vs. -2.4, respectively). Analyses assuming nonrandom missing data resulted in slightly larger differences. Clinically relevant change scores were estimated as two to three points for the LCS and five to seven points for the TOI, setting upper limits for minimal CMCs. These values were comparable to suggested distribution-based criteria of a minimally important difference. These results support use of a two to three point change in the LCS and five to six point change on the TOI of the FACT-L as a CMC, and offer practical direction for inclusion of important patient-based endpoints in lung cancer clinical trials.},

Main outcome measures Patients' estimated and actual survival. Results Median survival was 24 days. Only 20\% (92/468) of predictions were accurate (within 33\% of actual survival); 63\% (295/468) were overoptimistic and 17\% (81/468) were overpessimistic. Overall, doctors overestimated survival by a factor of 5.3. Few patient or doctor characteristics were associated with prognostic accuracy. Male patients were 58\% less likely to have overpessimistic predictions. Non-oncology medical specialists were 326\% more likely than general internists to make overpessimistic predictions. Doctors in the upper quartile of practice experience were the most accurate. As duration of doctor-patient relationship increased and time since last contact decreased, prognostic accuracy decreased. Conclusion Doctors are inaccurate in their prognoses for terminally ill patients and the error is systematically optimistic. The inaccuracy is, in general, not restricted to certain kinds of doctors or patients. These phenomena may be adversely affecting the quality of care given to patients near the end of life.},

Subjects resident in rural areas were more likely to misunderstand the goal of their treatment. Treatment modality was significantly associated with knowledge of treatment intent, and subjects in the last 6 months of life had clearer understanding that treatment intent was non-curative.

  abstract = {Previous quantitative reviews of research on psychotherapeutic interventions for bereaved persons have yielded divergent findings and have not included many of the available controlled outcome studies. This meta-analysis summarizes results from 61 controlled studies to offer a more comprehensive integration of this literature. This review examined (a) the absolute effectiveness of bereavement interventions immediately following intervention and at follow-up assessments, (b) several of the clinically and theoretically relevant moderators of outcome, and (c) change over time among recipients of the interventions and individuals in no-intervention control groups. Overall, analyses showed that interventions had a small effect at posttreatment but no statistically significant benefit at follow-up. However, interventions that exclusively targeted grievers displaying marked difficulties adapting to loss had outcomes that compare favorably with psychotherapies for other difficulties. Other evidence suggested that the discouraging results for studies failing to screen for indications of distress could be attributed to a tendency among controls to improve naturally over time. The findings of the review underscore the importance of attending to the targeted population in the practice and study of psychotherapeutic interventions for bereaved persons.

Simulation-based training improves skill acquisition, but effects on patient-reported outcomes are unknown.To assess the effects of a communication skills intervention for internal medicine and nurse practitioner trainees on patient- and family-reported outcomes.Randomized trial conducted with 391 internal medicine and 81 nurse practitioner trainees between 2007 and 2013 at the University of Washington and Medical University of South Carolina.Participants were randomized to an 8-session, simulation-based, communication skills intervention (N\,=\,232) or usual education (N\,=\,240).Primary outcome was patient-reported quality of communication (QOC; mean rating of 17 items rated from 0-10, with 0\,=\,poor and 10\,=\,perfect). Secondary outcomes were patient-reported quality of end-of-life care (QEOLC; mean rating of 26 items rated from 0-10) and depressive symptoms (assessed using the 8-item Personal Health Questionnaire [PHQ-8]; range, 0-24, higher scores worse) and family-reported QOC and QEOLC. Analyses were clustered by trainee.There were 1866 patient ratings (44\% response) and 936 family ratings (68\% response). The intervention was not associated with significant changes in QOC or QEOLC. Mean values for postintervention patient QOC and QEOLC were 6.5 (95\% CI, 6.2 to 6.8) and 8.3 (95\% CI, 8.1 to 8.5) respectively, compared with 6.3 (95\% CI, 6.2 to 6.5) and 8.3 (95\% CI, 8.1 to 8.4) for control conditions. After adjustment, comparing intervention with control, there was no significant difference in the QOC score for patients (difference, 0.4 points [95\% CI, -0.1 to 0.9]; P\,=\,.15) or families (difference, 0.1 [95\% CI, -0.8 to 1.0]; P\,=\,.81). There was no significant difference in QEOLC score for patients (difference, 0.3 points [95\% CI, -0.3 to 0.8]; P\,=\,.34) or families (difference, 0.1 [95\% CI, -0.7 to 0.8]; P\,=\,.88). The intervention was associated with significantly increased depression scores among patients of postintervention trainees (mean score, 10.0 [95\% CI, 9.1 to 10.8], compared with 8.8 [95\% CI, 8.4 to 9.2]) for control conditions; adjusted model showed an intervention effect of 2.2 (95\% CI, 0.6 to 3.8; P\,=\,.006).Among internal medicine and nurse practitioner trainees, simulation-based communication training compared with usual education did not improve quality of communication about end-of-life care or quality of end-of-life care but was associated with a small increase in patients' depressive symptoms. These findings raise questions about skills transfer from simulation training to actual patient care and the adequacy of communication skills assessment.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00687349},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The quality of communication with patients, family, and team members is an extremely important element in palliative cancer care. The current paper reviews the literature on these topics as published in 2004. RECENT FINDINGS: Trust was found to be a major factor for relationship building. Information gathered by patient self-report is the method of choice, given improved insight in symptom prevalence, duration, frequency, and interference. Cultural factors in information giving, the optimal process and content, and the difficulty of conveying hope were addressed. Decision making in palliative care requires a complex integration of conceptual knowledge, ethical and legal implications, and communication skills. Aspects of manageability are explored. Although health care providers must communicate about emotions, the existential distress of cancer patients and carers often goes overlooked in the last phases of life. SUMMARY: Themes included the education of health care providers, the need to care for carers, and interdisciplinary communication. Little attention was given to the growing population of elderly patients. Observer-based studies are unfortunately scarce, making the practice of palliative communication unseen. Finally, few studies report the cost-effectiveness of palliative care interventions though such studies may enhance palliative care and convince policy makers of the need to support such care. More empirical work is needed to improve the level of quality needed to ensure a good remaining lifetime for cancer patients whose disease cannot be cured.},

  abstract = {ObjectivesIn palliative care, effective communication is essential to adequately meet the needs and preferences of patients and their relatives. Effective communication includes exchanging information, facilitates shared decision-making, and promotes an empathic care relationship. We explored the perspectives of patients with an advanced illness and their relatives on effective communication with health-care professionals.MethodsA systematic review was conducted. We searched Embase, Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane for original empirical studies published between January 1, 2015 and March 4, 2021.ResultsIn total, 56 articles on 53 unique studies were included. We found 7 themes that from the perspectives of patients and relatives contribute to effective communication: (1) open and honest information. However, this open and honest communication can also trigger anxiety, stress, and existential disruption. Patients and relatives also indicated that they preferred (2) health-care professionals aligning to the patient's and relative's process of uptake and coping with information; (3) empathy; (4) clear and understandable language; (5) leaving room for positive coping strategies, (6) committed health-care professionals taking responsibility; and (7) recognition of relatives in their role as caregiver. Most studies in this review concerned communication with physicians in a hospital setting.Significance of resultsMost patients and relatives appreciate health-care professionals to not only pay attention to strictly medical issues but also to who they are as a person and the process they are going through. More research is needed on effective communication by nurses, in nonhospital settings and on communication by health-care professionals specialized in palliative care.},

  abstract = {The knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of elderly persons regarding living wills were explored in a rural county in eastern North Carolina. A questionnaire was administered to 75 ambulatory elderly persons by personal interview at community dining sites. Fifty-two percent (39) of these subjects said they were familiar with living wills and 64\% (48 persons) correctly summarized what the North Carolina living will says. When asked about preferences for medical care in the setting of a terminal illness, 86\% (65 persons) stated a desire to receive basic medical care or comfort care only. Although their preferences were consistent with the provisions of a living will, none had signed the living will document provided by the state of North Carolina, and only two (3\%) had discussed a living will with their physician. Seventy (93\%) wanted their family or spouse to make decisions about terminal care if they themselves were unable to participate, and discussions between these persons and their chosen proxies actually occurred 45\% (34/75) of the time. Eighty-one percent (61 persons) stated a desire to discuss end-of-life care with their physicians, but a minority (eight [11\%]) had actually talked with their physicians, and these discussions were usually initiated by the patient (five of eight). We conclude that living will legislation is congruent with the desire of many elderly persons to limit medical care in terminal illness. However, this elderly population did not make use of living wills as a means of indicating their wishes. Recommendations are made to improve physician-patient and patient-proxy communication regarding preferences for medical care at the end of life and living wills. Alternatives to the living will should also be explored.},

Objective: We examine if receiving palliative chemotherapy or radiation, and the perception of those treatments as curative or noncurative, is associated with prognostic understanding. Design: Cross-sectional analyses from a multisite, observational study. Setting/Subjects: Patients with advanced cancers refractory to at least one chemotherapy regimen (N\,=\,334). Measurements: In structured interviews, patients reported whether they were receiving chemotherapy or radiation, and whether its intent was curative or not. Their responses were categorized into three groups: patients not receiving chemotherapy/radiation (no cancer treatment group); patients receiving chemotherapy/radiation and misperceiving it as curative (treatment misperception group); and patients receiving chemotherapy/radiation and accurately perceiving it as noncurative (accurate treatment perception group). Patients also reported on various aspects of their prognostic understanding (e.g., life expectancy). Results: Eighty-six percent of the sample was receiving chemotherapy or radiation; of those, 16.7\% reported the purpose of treatment to be curative. The no-treatment group had higher prognostic understanding scores compared with the treatment misperception group (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\,=\,5.00, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). However, the accurate treatment perception group had the highest prognostic understanding scores in comparison to the no-treatment group (AOR\,=\,2.04, p\,{$<$}\,0.05) and the treatment misperception group (AOR\,=\,10.19, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Conclusions: Depending on patient perceptions of curative intent, receipt of palliative chemotherapy or radiation is associated with better or worse prognostic understanding. Research should examine if enhancing patients' understanding of treatment intent can improve accurate prognostic expectations.},

Methods and measurements A prospective cohort study in four multi-professional palliative care teams in England collected data on 275 consecutive cancer referrals who died. Prognosis estimates (minimum -- maximum) at referral, patient characteristics, were recorded by staff, and later compared with actual survival. Results Minimum survival estimates ranged {$<$}1 to 364 days, maximum 7 -- 686 days. Mean patient survival was 71 days (range 1 -- 734). In 42\% the estimate was accurate, in 36\% it was over optimistic and in 22\% over pessimistic. When the minimum estimate was less than 14 days accuracy increased to 70\%. Accuracy was related, in multivariate analysis, to palliative care team and (of borderline significance) patient age. Conclusions Offering a prognosis range has higher levels of accuracy (about double) than traditional estimates, but is still very often inaccurate, except very close to death. Where possible clinicians should discuss scenarios with patients, rather than giving a prognosis range.},

  abstract = {Purpose Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease. Many patients experience a heavy burden of cancer-associated symptoms and poor quality of life (QOL). Early palliative care alongside standard oncologic care results in improved QOL and survival in some cancer types. The benefit in advanced pancreatic cancer (APC) is not fully quantified. Methods In this prospective case-crossover study, patients\,{$\geq$}\,18~years old with APC were recruited from ambulatory clinics at a tertiary cancer center. Patients underwent a palliative care consultation within 2~weeks of registration, with follow up visits every 2~weeks for the first month, then every 4~weeks until week 16, then as needed. The primary outcome was change in QOL between baseline (BL) and week 16, measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -- hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep). Secondary outcomes included symptom control (ESAS-r), depression, and anxiety (HADS, PHQ-9) at week 16. Results Of 40 patients, 25 (63\%) were male, 28 (70\%) had metastatic disease, 31 (78\%) had ECOG performance status 0--1, 31 (78\%) received chemotherapy. Median age was 70. Mean FACT-hep score at BL was 118.8, compared to 125.7 at week 16 (mean change 6.89, [95\%CI (-1.69--15.6); p\,=\,0.11]). On multivariable analysis, metastatic disease (mean change 15.3 [95\%CI (5.3--25.2); p\,=\,0.004]) and age\,{$<$}\,70 (mean change 12.9 [95\%CI (0.5--25.4); p\,=\,0.04]) were associated with improved QOL. Patients with metastatic disease had significant improvement in symptom burden (mean change -7.4 [95\%CI (-13.4 to -1.4); p\,=\,0.02]). There was no difference in depression or anxiety from BL to week 16. Conclusion Palliative care should be integrated early in the journey for patients with APC, as it can improve QOL and symptom burden. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03837132.},

Their prediction of prognosis informs decision-making ranging from recommendations of cancer treatments to hospice enrollment.

Further, physicians often fail to disclose their prognosis estimates, despite patient wishes to the contrary. Several studies have examined patient factors that might improve physicians' prognostic accuracy, including performance status, clinical symptoms and laboratory values.

We performed a retrospective analysis of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 5592, a phase III randomized trial of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and compared outcomes in enrollees 70 years of age and older with those in younger patients. Methods: ECOG carried out a randomized phase III trial of cisplatin plus either etoposide or paclitaxel in chemotherapy-na{\"i}ve NSCLC patients with stages IIIB or IV disease. Toxic effects, response rates, and survival rates were compared between age groups. All P values were two-sided. Results: A total of 574 patients enrolled from August 1993 through December 1994 were evaluable. Eighty-six (15\%) were 70 years old or older. Older patients had a higher incidence of cardiovascular (P = .009) and respiratory (P = .04) comorbidities and nonanalgesic medication use (P = .02). Leukopenia (P\&lt;.001) and neuropsychiatric toxicity (P = .002) were more common in elderly men than in younger men. Elderly women lost more weight than younger women (P = .006). Other toxic effects were similar in older and younger patients. The proportions with clinical partial or complete response (21.5\% versus 23.3\%; Fisher's exact test, P = .66), median time to progression (4.37 versus 4.30 months; log-rank test, P = .29), and survival distribution (log-rank test, P = .29; median survival, 9.05 versus 8.53 months; 1-year survival, 38\% versus 29\%; and 2-year survival, 14\% versus 12\%) were similar in patients younger than 70 years and 70 years old or older. Baseline quality-of-life and treatment-outcome indices were similar. Equivalent declines over time in functional well-being occurred in both groups. Conclusion: Response rate, toxicity, and survival in fit, elderly NSCLC patients receiving platinum-based treatment appear to be similar to those in younger patients, although patients 70 years old or older have more comorbidities and can expect more leukopenia and neuropsychiatric toxicity. Advanced age alone should not preclude appropriate NSCLC treatment.},

Barriers to end-of-life discussions that have been identified in patients and families, health care professionals, and health care systems can seriously interfere with the quality of remaining life for terminally ill patients. Strategies for enhancing end-of-life discussions are most productively linked to (1) physicians' interpersonal communication skills, (2) a patient-centered model of care, (3) a focus on quality of remaining life, and (4) innovative clinical models for implementing these discussions earlier in the care process. We conclude that end-of-life conversations must become a routine, structured intervention in health care and that advance care planning is best viewed as one component in a series of ongoing end-of-life discussions. Randomized trials are needed to examine new approaches and models for enhancing end-of-life conversations.},

This paper will demonstrate that existing diagnoses are not sufficient, as the phenomenology, risk factors, clinical correlates, course, and outcomes for CG are distinct from those of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and adjustment disorder (AD). It is argued that the establishment of CG as a diagnostic entity is essential because its symptoms are associated with enduring mental and physical health morbidity and require specifically designed clinical interventions. We conduct a critical review of all published evidence on this topic to date, demonstrating that the advantages of standardizing the diagnostic criteria of CG outweigh the disadvantages. In addition, recommendations for future lines of research are made. This paper concludes that CG must be established in the current nosology to address the needs of individuals who are significantly suffering and impaired by this disorder.},

Methods               A Working Group of the Research Network of the European Association for Palliative Care identified clinically significant topics, reviewed the studies, and assigned the level of evidence. A formal meta-analysis was not feasible because of the heterogeneity of published studies and the lack of minimal standards in reporting results. A systematic electronic literature search within the main available medical literature databases was performed for each of the following four areas identified: clinical prediction of survival (CPS), biologic factors, clinical signs and symptoms and psychosocial variables, and prognostic scores. Only studies on patients with advanced cancer and survival {$\leq$} 90 days were included.                                         Results               A total of 38 studies were evaluated. Level A evidence-based recommendations of prognostic correlation could be formulated for CPS (albeit with a series of limitations of which clinicians must be aware) and prognostic scores. Recommendations on the use of other prognostic factors, such as performance status, symptoms associated with cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome (weight loss, anorexia, dysphagia, and xerostomia), dyspnea, delirium, and some biologic factors (leukocytosis, lymphocytopenia, and C-reactive protein), reached level B.                                         Conclusion               Prognostication of life expectancy is a significant clinical commitment for clinicians involved in oncology and palliative care. More accurate prognostication is feasible and can be achieved by combining clinical experience and evidence from the literature. Using and communicating prognostic information should be part of a multidisciplinary palliative care approach.},

For the present study, the Positive and Negative Effects of Psychotherapy Scale (PANEPS) was evaluated in a population of individuals with depression who had completed at least one course of face-to-face psychotherapy. A total of 135 individuals with a current or previous depressive episode as verified by a diagnostic interview filled out the online version of the PANEPS, which is designed to capture both positive and adverse events. Factor analysis yielded four dimensions: positive effects, side effects, malpractice, and unethical conduct. Internal consistency of the individual subscales was satisfactory to excellent (Cronbach's {$\alpha$}: 0.72 and 0.92). Positive effects were reported by virtually all patients (95.6\%). At the same time, approximately half of the sample noted at least one adverse event (52.6\%). Among these, side effects (38.5\%) and malpractice (26.7\%) were significantly more prevalent than unethical conduct (8.1\%). As expected, positive effects were negatively correlated with adverse events. Our results challenge the common clinical assumption that some degree of destabilization is necessary for symptom improvement. The survey was conducted anonymously, and the sample underwent diagnostic verification. The results indicate a need for improved treatment guidelines and mechanisms to monitor treatment.},

  abstract = {Objective Communication about patients' values, goals, and prognosis in serious illness (serious illness communication) is a cornerstone of person-centered care yet difficult to implement in practice. As part of Serious Illness Care Program implementation in five health systems, we studied the clinical culture-related factors that supported or impeded improvement in serious illness conversations. Methods Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews of clinical leaders, implementation teams, and frontline champions. Results We completed 30 interviews across palliative care, oncology, primary care, and hospital medicine. Participants identified four culture-related domains that influenced serious illness communication improvement: (1) clinical paradigms; (2) interprofessional empowerment; (3) perceived conversation impact; (4) practice norms. Changes in clinicians' beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors in these domains supported values and goals conversations, including: shifting paradigms about serious illness communication from `end-of-life planning' to `knowing and honoring what matters most to patients;' improvements in psychological safety that empowered advanced practice clinicians, nurses and social workers to take expanded roles; experiencing benefits of earlier values and goals conversations; shifting from avoidant norms to integration norms in which earlier serious illness discussions became part of routine processes. Culture-related inhibitors included: beliefs that conversations are about dying or withdrawing care; attitudes that serious illness communication is the physician's job; discomfort managing emotions; lack of reliable processes. Conclusions Aspects of clinical culture, such as paradigms about serious illness communication and inter-professional empowerment, are linked to successful adoption of serious illness communication. Further research is warranted to identify effective strategies to enhance clinical culture and drive clinician practice change.

A week after admission predicted and actual survival correlated more closely but predictions were still optimistic., It is concluded that predictions of the length of time which a cancer patient who is at the end of active treatment can be expected to survive should be made and interpreted with the greatest caution.},

  abstract = {Background Weighing risks and benefits is currently the primary criterion for decisions regarding systemic anticancer treatment (SACT) in far advanced cancer patients, also in the modern immunotherapy- and molecular-targeted driven oncology. Decision aids rarely include substantially key concepts of early integrated palliative care (PC) and communication science. We compiled decisional factors (DFs) important for guiding the use of SACT with palliative intent (SACT-PI) and explored these DFs regarding their applicability in routine clinical care. Patients and methods Clinician (participants: n~= 28) and patient (n~= 15) focus groups were conducted in an integrated oncology and PC setting. Thematic analysis was used to identify DFs. A Delphi survey of clinicians ranked the importance of DFs in routine decision-making. DFs were aligned with elements of the typical decision-making process, resulting in an eight-step guide for making SACT-PI decisions in clinical practice. Results Eight focus groups revealed 55 DFs relating to established topics like providing information and risk--benefit analysis, as well as to PC topics like patients' attitudes, beliefs, and hopes; patient--physician interaction; and physician attitudes. Agreement on the relative importance was reached for 34 (62\%) of 55 DFs, assigned to five elements: patient/family, clinicians/system, patient-clinician-interaction, information/patient education, risk--benefit weighting/actual decision. These themes are embedded in a potential clinically useful SACT-PI Decision Framework, which includes eight steps: assess, educate, verify, reflect, discuss, weigh, pause, and decide. Conclusions The SACT-PI Decision Framework integrates subjective patient factors, interpersonal factors, and PC issues into decision-making. Our findings complement existing decision aids and prompt lists by framing DFs in the context of SACT-PI and enforce the decision `process', not the decision act. Further research is needed to explore the relative importance of DFs in specific patient situations and test structured decision-making processes, such as our SACT-PI Decision Framework, against standard care.},

METHODS:               Using linked administrative databases, we created a retrospective cohort of cancer decedents between 2004 and 2014 in Ontario, Canada. We identified those who received early palliative care (palliative care service used in the hospital or community 12 to 6 months before death [exposure]). We used propensity score matching to identify a control group of not-early palliative care, hard matched on age, sex, cancer type, and stage at diagnosis. We examined differences in average health system costs (including hospital, emergency department, physician, and home care costs) between groups in the last month of life.                                         RESULTS:               We identified 144,306 cancer decedents, of which 37\% received early palliative care. After matching, we created 36,238 pairs of decedents who received early and not-early (control) palliative care; there were balanced distributions of age, sex, cancer type (24\% lung cancer), and stage (25\% stage III and IV). Overall, 56.3\% of early group versus 66.7\% of control group used inpatient care in the last month ( P {$<$} .001). Considering inpatient hospital costs in the last month of life, the early group used an average ({\textpm}standard deviation) of \$7,105 ({\textpm}\$10,710) versus the control group of \$9,370 ({\textpm}\$13,685; P {$<$} .001). Overall average costs ({\textpm}standard deviation) in the last month of life for patients in the early versus control group was \$12,753 ({\textpm}\$10,868) versus \$14,147 ({\textpm}\$14,288; P {$<$} .001).                                         CONCLUSION:               Receiving early palliative care reduced average health system costs in the last month of life, especially via avoided hospitalizations.},

This review focuses on conversations about end-of-life care with frail and older people who have no main overriding diagnosis who are estimated to account for around 40\% of deaths. Aim To investigate the attitudes of the public and healthcare professionals to advance care planning discussions with frail and older people. Design and setting Systematic literature review and narrative synthesis. Method Articles that related to frail or older individuals and either advance care plans or discussions on end-of-life care were included. Studies of specific conditions or that focused on prognosis, capacity, or resuscitation decisions were excluded. Results While a significant minority of frail older individuals would find them unwelcome, the majority would appreciate the chance to discuss end-of-life care, yet most do not have this opportunity. Attitudes to the timing of these discussions were variable, but most perceived the risk of leaving them too late. Most doctors believed it was their professional responsibility to initiate discussions, but felt limited by time pressures and the absence of a precipitating event. A wide range of barriers were identified including the reluctance of family members to discuss end-of-life care, the passive expectation that someone else would decide on an individual's behalf, and significant uncertainty concerning future illness and decline. Conclusion The marked disparity between the majority of older individuals who would like the opportunity to discuss their end-of-life care and the minority that currently have this opportunity raises important questions if the wishes of this large group in society are to be respected. The challenge is to find effective ways of encouraging dialogue and choice within the constraints of the current healthcare systems and personal circumstances.},

Loss of a loved one usually leads to acute grief characterized by yearning and longing, decreased interest in ongoing activities, and frequent thoughts of the deceased. For most, acute grief naturally evolves into a state of integrated grief, where the bereaved is able to reengage with everyday activities and find interest or pleasure. About 7\% of bereaved older adults, however, will develop the mental health condition of Complicated Grief (CG). In CG, the movement from acute to integrated grief is derailed, and grief symptoms remain severe and impairing. This article reviews recent publications on the diagnosis of CG, risk factors for the condition, and evidenced-based treatments for CG. Greater attention to complicated grief detection and treatment in older adults is needed.},

  abstract = {Serious illness communications are crucial elements of care delivery for patients with cancer. High-quality serious illness communications are composed of open, honest discussions between patients, caregivers, and clinicians regarding patient's communication preferences, expected illness trajectory, prognosis, and risks and benefits of any recommended care. High-quality communication ideally starts at the time of a patients' cancer diagnosis, allows space for and response to patient emotions, elicits patients' values and care preferences, and is iterative and longitudinal. When integrated into cancer care, such communication can result in improved patient experiences with their care, care that matches patients' goals, and reduced care intensity at the end of life. Despite national recommendations for routine integration of these communication into cancer care, a minority of patients with cancer receive such communication. In this chapter, we describe elements of high-quality serious illness communication, patient-, clinician-, institution-, and payer-level barriers, and successful strategies that can routinely integrate such communication into cancer care delivery.}

How to protect the bereaved against extreme suffering and lasting health impairment remains a central research issue. It has been widely accepted that to adjust, the bereaved have to confront and express intense emotions accompanying their loss. It has further been assumed that others assist in this process, and that intervention programs are effective. To assess validity of these assumptions, this article reviews research on the impact of expressing and sharing emotions across four research domains (social support; emotional disclosure; experimentally induced emotional disclosure; and grief intervention). In none of these areas is there evidence that emotional disclosure facilitates adjustment to loss in normal bereavement. Implications of these findings are discussed.},

Participants comprised 23\,154 patients with advanced lung cancer (stage IIIB and stage IV) who received care in the Veterans Affairs health care system. Data were analyzed from February 15, 2019, to April 28, 2019.Palliative care defined as a specialist-delivered palliative care encounter received after lung cancer diagnosis.The primary outcome was survival. The association between palliative care and place of death was also examined. Propensity score and time-varying covariate methods were used to calculate Cox proportional hazards and to perform regression modeling.Of the 23\,154 patients enrolled in the study, 57\% received palliative care. The mean (SD) age of participants was 68 (9.5) years, and 98\% of participants were men. An examination of the timing of palliative care receipt relative to cancer diagnosis found that palliative care received 0 to 30 days after diagnosis was associated with decreases in survival (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR],\,2.13; 95\% CI, 1.97-2.30), palliative care received 31 to 365 days after diagnosis was associated with increases in  survival (aHR, 0.47; 95\% CI, 0.45-0.49), and palliative care received more than 365 days after diagnosis was associated with no difference in survival (aHR, 1.00; 95\% CI, 0.94-1.07) compared with nonreceipt of palliative care. Receipt of palliative care was also associated with a reduced risk of death in an acute care setting (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95\% CI, 0.52-0.64) compared with nonreceipt of palliative care.The results suggest that palliative care was associated with a survival benefit among patients with advanced lung cancer. Palliative care should be considered a complementary approach to disease-modifying therapy in patients with advanced lung cancer.},

Bereaved participants (n = 53) who had completed bereavement counselling were recruited either online or via counselling organizations. In an online survey, they provided information about client-, loss- and counselling-related variables, present grief severity, negative effects of counselling and client satisfaction. In a hierarchical linear regression analysis controlling for recruitment strategy, online-recruited participants were less satisfied. In a second step additionally considering number of sessions, grief severity and negative effects, experiencing more negative effects predicted lower client satisfaction. The results indicate that negative effects could play an important role for client satisfaction. More research is needed to investigate this phenomenon.},

They also received less aggressive care at the end of life, but surprisingly, had significantly longer survival than did patients receiving standard care alone. The quality of care and the use of medical services for seriously ill patients are key elements in the ongoing debate over reform of the U.S. health care system.1 Oncologic care is central to this debate, largely because anticancer treatments are often intensive and costly.2 Comprehensive oncologic services for patients with metastatic disease would ideally improve the patients' quality of life and facilitate the efficient allocation of medical resources.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Although the prediction of the duration of life of patients with end of life cancer most often relies on the clinical estimation of survival (CES) made by the treating physician, the accuracy and practical value of CES remains controversial. METHODS The authors prospectively evaluated the accuracy of CES in an inception and population-based cohort of 233 cancer patients who were seen at the onset of their terminal phase. They also systematically reviewed the literature on CES in advanced or end-stage cancer patients in MEDLINE, CANCERLIT, and EMBASE data bases, using two search strategies developed by a research librarian. RESULTS CES had low sensitivity in detecting patients who died within shorter time frames ({$\leq$}2 months), and a tendency to overestimate survival was noted. A moderate correlation was observed between actual survival (AS) and CES (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.47, intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.46, weighted kappa coefficient = 0.42). CONCLUSIONS Treating physicians appear to overestimate the duration of life of end of life ill cancer patients, particularly those patients who die early in the terminal phase and who may potentially benefit from earlier participation in palliative care programs. CES should be considered one of many criteria, rather than a unique criterion, by which to choose therapeutic intervention or health care programs for patients in the end of life cancer phase.

  abstract = {Background Prognostic accuracy in palliative care is valued by patients, carers, and healthcare professionals. Previous reviews suggest clinicians are inaccurate at survival estimates, but have only reported the accuracy of estimates on patients with a cancer diagnosis. Objectives To examine the accuracy of clinicians' estimates of survival and to determine if any clinical profession is better at doing so than another. Data Sources MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Trials. All databases were searched from the start of the database up to June 2015. Reference lists of eligible articles were also checked. Eligibility Criteria Inclusion criteria: patients over 18, palliative population and setting, quantifiable estimate based on real patients, full publication written in English. Exclusion criteria: if the estimate was following an intervention, such as surgery, or the patient was artificially ventilated or in intensive care. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods A quality assessment was completed with the QUIPS tool. Data on the reported accuracy of estimates and information about the clinicians were extracted. Studies were grouped by type of estimate: categorical (the clinician had a predetermined list of outcomes to choose from), continuous (open-ended estimate), or probabilistic (likelihood of surviving a particular time frame). Results 4,642 records were identified; 42 studies fully met the review criteria. Wide variation was shown with categorical estimates (range 23\% to 78\%) and continuous estimates ranged between an underestimate of 86 days to an overestimate of 93 days. The four papers which used probabilistic estimates tended to show greater accuracy (c-statistics of 0.74--0.78). Information available about the clinicians providing the estimates was limited. Overall, there was no clear ``expert'' subgroup of clinicians identified. Limitations High heterogeneity limited the analyses possible and prevented an overall accuracy being reported. Data were extracted using a standardised tool, by one reviewer, which could have introduced bias. Devising search terms for prognostic studies is challenging. Every attempt was made to devise search terms that were sufficiently sensitive to detect all prognostic studies; however, it remains possible that some studies were not identified. Conclusion Studies of prognostic accuracy in palliative care are heterogeneous, but the evidence suggests that clinicians' predictions are frequently inaccurate. No sub-group of clinicians was consistently shown to be more accurate than any other. Implications of Key Findings Further research is needed to understand how clinical predictions are formulated and how their accuracy can be improved.},

Without evidence that end-of-life discussions improve patient outcomes, physicians must balance their desire to honor patient autonomy against a concern of inflicting psychological harm.To determine whether end-of-life discussions with physicians are associated with fewer aggressive interventions.A US multisite, prospective, longitudinal cohort study of patients with advanced cancer and their informal caregivers (n~=~332dyads), September 2002-February 2008. Patients were followed up from enrollment to death, a median of 4.4 months later. Bereaved caregivers' psychiatric illness and quality of life was assessed a median of 6.5 months later.Aggressive medical care (eg, ventilation, resuscitation) and hospice in the final week of life. Secondary outcomes included patients' mental health and caregivers' bereavement adjustment.One hundred twenty-three of 332 (37.0\%) patients reported having end-of-life discussions before baseline. Such discussions were not associated with higher rates of major depressive disorder (8.3\% vs 5.8\%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-3.32), or more worry (mean McGill score, 6.5 vs 7.0; P~=~.19).

Our objectives were to (1) identify key elements of early PC clinic visits, (2) explore the timing of key elements, and (3) compare the content of PC and oncologic visit notes at the critical time points of clinical deterioration and radiographic disease progression.We randomly selected 20 patients who received early PC and survived within 4 periods: less than 3 months (n~=~5), 3 to 6 months (n~=~5), 6 to 12 months (n~=~5), and 12 to 24 months (n~=~5). We performed content analysis on PC and oncologic visit notes from the electronic health records of these patients.Addressing symptoms and coping were the most prevalent components of the PC clinic visits. Initial visits focused on building relationships and rapport with patients and their families and on illness understanding, including prognostic awareness. Discussions about resuscitation preferences and hospice predominantly occurred during later visits. Comparing PC and oncologic care visits around critical time points, both included discussions about symptoms and illness status; however, PC visits emphasized psychosocial elements, such as coping, whereas oncologic care visits focused on cancer treatment and management of medical complications.Early PC clinic visits emphasize managing symptoms, strengthening coping, and cultivating illness understanding and prognostic awareness in a responsive and time-sensitive model. During critical clinical time points, PC and oncologic care visits have distinct features that suggest a key role for PC involvement and enable oncologists to focus on cancer treatment and managing medical complications.},
