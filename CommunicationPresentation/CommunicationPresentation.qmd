# Introduction

## What is palliative care?

![Trayectorias de la enfermedad y fases de los cuidados paliativos [@RACGP2023] ](Bilder/palli-phases.jpg)



## Early Palliative Care for Patients with Metastatic NSCLC 
[@TemelEtAl2010]

- Ambulatory patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC 
- Early palliative care + standard oncologic care vs. standard oncologic care 
- Board-certified palliative care physicians and advanced-practice nurses 


## Quality of life

![An improvement of TOI (Trial Outcome Index) of 5 points is similar to that of **patients who responded** to cisplatin-based chemotherapy [@TemelEtAl2010] ](Bilder/QoL.png)

::: notes 
This compared to the Results from Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Study 5592. 

**Complete or partial response (95)** is meant in contrast to stable (82) or progressive disease (102). 

Patients had (stage IIIb and IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), were ambulatory (ECOG 0 or 1) and recieved either:

- cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV over 1 hr plus etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV X 3 (days 1, 2, and 3)
- cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV over 1 hr plus standard dose paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 IV) over 24 hr, or
- cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV over 1 hr plus higher dose paclitaxel (250 mg/m2 IV) over 24 hr with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (g-csf) support (5 	g/kg/day).

## ECOG Trial 

599 patients with NSCLC were randomly assigned to receive ^[Comparison of Survival and Quality of Life in Advanced Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated With Two Dose Levels of Paclitaxel Combined With Cisplatin Versus Etoposide With Cisplatin  [@BonomiEtAl2000] ]

- cisplatin plus etoposide 100 
- cisplatin plus standard dose paclitaxel  
- cisplatin plus higher dose paclitaxel with (g-csf) 

::: notes
g-csf: filgrastim

## The objective response rate ^[Comparison of Survival and Quality of Life in Advanced Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients Treated With Two Dose Levels of Paclitaxel Combined With Cisplatin Versus Etoposide With Cisplatin  [@BonomiEtAl2000] ]

(complete + partial remissions)

- Cis/Eto **12.4%**
- Cis/Pacli **25.3%**
- Cis/Pacli (high dose) **27.7%**

::: notes
Response rates for the two dose levels of paclitaxel were not significantly different (P = .264).

## Depressive symptoms

![ Early integration led to significantly lower (almost 50%) Rates of depression [@TemelEtAl2010] ](Bilder/DepressiveSymptoms.png)

::: notes

Depressive symptoms were assessed with the use of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which consists of two subscales, one for symptoms of anxiety (HADS-A) and one for symptoms of depression (HADS-D)

The PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire 9) is a nine-item measure that evaluates symptoms of major depressive disorder according to the criteria of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).

## Survival

## The Role of Communication in Palliative Care


## In the study by Temel et.al. 
Specific attention was paid to 

::: {.fragment}
- psychosocial symptoms
- establishing goals of care 
- assisting with decision making regarding treatment
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- coordinating care on the basis of the individual needs of the patient
- physical symptoms

## Early Palliative Care in Advanced Lung Cancer: A Qualitative Study

"PC clinicians focused on establishing relationships with patients and determining their individual needs and preferences for information early in the illness."[@YoongEtAl2013]



## 

- relationship and rapport building
- addressing symptoms 
- addressing coping
- establishing illness understanding
- discussing cancer treatments
- end-of-life (EOL) planning
- engaging family members

## Benefits 


"Interventions that focus on communication about palliative and end-of-life care, using palliative care specialists, have demonstrated improved quality of life, decreased symptoms of depression, and reduced intensity of care at the end of life." [@CurtisEtAl2013]


## Intervention 

[@CurtisEtAl2013] conducted a study involving an intervention based on a residential workshop designed to enhance communication skills for oncology fellows. The intervention consisted of **eight 4-hour sessions** led by a physician and a nurse .


## Side effects

- A significant increase in depressive symptoms, with an increase of **2.2 PHQ-8 points.** 

- Depression scores for patients of the most senior trainees were **significantly lower** than those for patients of first-year residents.

::: notes
One of the questionnaires most commonly used for the screening and severity assessment of depression in clinical settings and epidemiological studies is the PHQ (Patient health questionnaire). This is a self-reported measure of depressive symptoms composed of 9 Likert-type items each of them corresponding to one of the 9 criteria for major depressive disorder of the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) [@TorreEtAl2023]
:::

::: notes
Simulation to learn skills for communicating bad news to patients with cancer forms the basis of a 4-day workshop for medical oncology fellows.

This workshop has been associated with significant improvement in participants’ ability to deliver bad news and discuss transitions to palliative care. Clinicians can learn skills for communicating about palliative care in small-group facilitated settings using simulated patients and family members.

A systematic review of communication skills interventions noted the effectiveness of interventions using simulation but observed that no studies have shown an effect on patient-reported outcomes.

We conducted a randomized trial to examine whether a communication skills–building workshop aimed at internal medicine and nurse practitioner trainees, using simulation during which trainees practiced skills associated with palliative and end-of-life care communication, had any effect on patient-, family-, and clinician-reported outcomes.

## Focus: Generalist palliative care

- No standardly accepted definition 
- Treatment is provided by staff whose main field of work is not in palliative care
- The patient situation is less complex 
- Structural requirements are not compulsory

## Specialist palliative care

A specialist palliative care core team ***must*** comprise members
from at least three professional groups 

- physician 
- nursing profession 
- other professional group 

Of these at least the physician and nurse must possess a specialist palliative care qualification.

## Who bennefits from specialist palliative care?

- Complex symptoms or distress due to problems 
- Uncertainty in setting treatment goals 
- Complex medical or nursing care 
- Home care is overstrained or uncertain

## Bereavement

losing a loved one to death (or dying) is an inherent part of human life and  only about 7% of bereaved older adults will develop complicated grief. [@ShearEtAl2013]

## Elements of communication in Palliative Care

- Clarification of treatment goals
- Breaking bad news 
- Communicating Prognosis
- Advanced care planning (talking about dying)
- Referral to a palliative care unit

Adapted from: Communication in Palliative Care and About End of Life: A State-of-the-Art Literature Review of Conversation-Analytic Research in Healthcare [@Parry2024]
::: 

## Clarification

- 58.2 % of the patients had an inaccurate perception of treatment intent ^[@SoyluEtAl2016]

- 20% considered their illness to be non-life threatening ^[@CraftEtAl2005]

- Of Patients that recieved palliative chemotherapy or radiation 16.7% reported the purpose of treatment to be curative ^[@GeorgeEtAl2020]

## Prognosis

- Only 25% of the physicians’ predictions of survival were accurate within 1 month. Two-thirds was overestimated, particularly for those patients who had shorter survival. ^[@ViganoEtAl1999]

- Prognostic error is widespread, only around 20% of estimates are accurate  ^[@HigginsonCostantini2002]

- Only 20% of predictions were accurate within 33% of actual survival ^[@ChristakisLamont2000]
