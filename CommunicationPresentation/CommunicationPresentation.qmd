# What is palliative care?

![Trayectorias de la enfermedad y fases de los cuidados paliativos [@RACGP2023] ](Bilder/palli-phases.jpg)


## Focus: generalist palliative care 

- No standardly accepted definition of generalist palliative care

- Treatment service is provided by staff whose main field of work is not in palliative care

- The patient situation is less complex than in specialist palliative care

- It is not compulsory that the care service is linked with specific structural requirements.

# The Role of Communication in Palliative Care

## Benefits 

> Interventions that focus on communication about palliative and end-oflife care, using palliative care specialists, have demonstrated improved quality of life, decreased symptoms of depression, and reduced intensity of care at the end of life. [@CurtisEtAl2013]

## Early Palliative Care for Patients with Metastatic NSCLC 
[@TemelEtAl2010]

- Ambulatory patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC 
- Early palliative care + standard oncologic care vs. standard oncologic care 
- Board-certified palliative care physicians and advanced-practice nurses 

## Specific attention was paid to

- psychosocial symptoms
- establishing goals of care 
- assisting with decision making regarding treatment

- coordinating care on the basis of the individual needs of the patient
- physical symptoms

## Quality of life

![An improvement of TOI (Trial Outcome Index) of 5 points is similar to that of **patients who responded** to cisplatin-based chemotherapy [@TemelEtAl2010] ](Bilder/QoL.png)

::: notes 
This compared to the Results from Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Study 5592. 

**Complete or partial response (95)** is meant in contrast to stable (82) or progressive disease (102). 

Patients had (stage IIIb and IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), were ambulatory (ECOG 0 or 1) and recieved either:

- cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV over 1 hr plus etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV X 3 (days 1, 2, and 3)
- cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV over 1 hr plus standard dose paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 IV) over 24 hr, or
- cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV over 1 hr plus higher dose paclitaxel (250 mg/m2 IV) over 24 hr with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (g-csf) support (5 	g/kg/day).

## Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Study 5592 

599 patients with NSCLC were randomly assigned to receive

- cisplatin plus etoposide 100 
- cisplatin plus standard dose paclitaxel  
- cisplatin plus higher dose paclitaxel with (g-csf)

## Depressive symptoms

![ Early integration led to significantly lower (almost 50%) Rates of depression [@TemelEtAl2010] ](Bilder/DepressiveSymptoms.png)

::: notes

Depressive symptoms were assessed with the use of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which consists of two subscales, one for symptoms of anxiety (HADS-A) and one for symptoms of depression (HADS-D)

The PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire 9) is a nine-item measure that evaluates symptoms of major depressive disorder according to the criteria of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).

# Side effects of communication

::: notes
Simulation to learn skills for communicating bad news to patients with cancer forms the basis of a 4-day workshop for medical oncology fellows.

This workshop has been associated with significant improvement in participants’ ability to deliver bad news and discuss transitions to palliative care. Clinicians can learn skills for communicating about palliative care in small-group facilitated settings using simulated patients and family members.

A systematic review of communication skills interventions noted the effectiveness of interventions using simulation but observed that no studies have shown an effect on patient-reported outcomes.

We conducted a randomized trial to examine whether a communication skills–building workshop aimed at internal medicine and nurse practitioner trainees, using simulation during which trainees practiced skills associated with palliative and end-of-life care communication, had any effect on patient-, family-, and clinician-reported outcomes.
:::

## Depressive Symptoms [@CurtisEtAl2013]

- A significant increase in depressive symptoms, with an increase of **2.2 PHQ-8 points.** 

- Depression scores for patients of the most senior trainees were **significantly lower** than those for patients of first-year residents.

::: notes
One of the questionnaires most commonly used for the screening and severity assessment of depression in clinical settings and epidemiological studies is the PHQ (Patient health questionnaire). This is a self-reported measure of depressive symptoms composed of 9 Likert-type items each of them corresponding to one of the 9 criteria for major depressive disorder of the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) [@TorreEtAl2023]
:::

## Multiprofessional Team 

A specialist palliative care core team ***must*** comprise members
from at least three professional groups ^[S3-Guideline: Palliative care for patients with incurable cancer [@GermanCancerSociety2015]]

- physician 
- nursing profession 
- other professional group 

Of these at least the physician and nurse must possess a specialist palliative care qualification.
