Clinicians can learn skills for communicating about palliative care in small-group facilitated settings using simulated patients and family members.\nA systematic review of communication skills interventions noted the effectiveness of interventions using simulation but observed that no studies have shown an effect on patient-reported outcomes.\nWe conducted a randomized trial to examine whether a communication skills–building workshop aimed at internal medicine and nurse practitioner trainees, using simulation during which trainees practiced skills associated with palliative and end-of-life care communication, had any effect on patient-, family-, and clinician-reported outcomes.\n\nDepressive Symptoms (Curtis et al. 2013)\n\nA significant increase in depressive symptoms, with an increase of 2.2 PHQ-8 points.\nDepression scores for patients of the most senior trainees were significantly lower than those for patients of first-year residents.\n\n\nOne of the questionnaires most commonly used for the screening and severity assessment of depression in clinical settings and epidemiological studies is the PHQ (Patient health questionnaire). This is a self-reported measure of depressive symptoms composed of 9 Likert-type items each of them corresponding to one of the 9 criteria for major depressive disorder of the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (Torre et al. 2023)"
