After correction for the expected mortality, it was found that age at diagnosis was an important predictor of the probability of escaping the risk of dying of breast cancer (relative survival), with a regular trend toward a more favorable course in younger women. This difference between the age groups is apparent as early as 5 years after diagnosis and increases throughout the period of observation. Thus the relative 20-year survival rates {\textpm} 95\% confidence limits were 51.3 {\textpm} 3.8\%, 41.2 {\textpm} 3.4\%, 34.2 {\textpm} 3.8\%, and 16.6 {\textpm} 6.3\% at ages 40 through 44, 50 through 54, 60 through 69, and 70 through 79 years, respectively.

  abstract = {Due to the high incidence of breast cancer in the United States, optimal strategies for its prevention are imperative. This entails identification of women who are at an increased risk for breast cancer and an integrative approach that includes effective screening methods as well as nutritional, pharmacologic, and surgical management. Several breast cancer risk-assessment tools, such as the Gail and Claus models, can help clinicians determine the quantitative risk of breast cancer. The role of selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, for the prevention of breast cancer has been well established. Several other agents, such as aromatase inhibitors, are currently being investigated. The potential adverse effects of these chemopreventive agents, which include an impact on the quality of life, must be discussed with the patient before deciding on this approach. Additionally, breast cancer risk factors have been identified over the years; some of them are modifiable, but others are not. Although there is no conclusive evidence to suggest the protective role of specific dietary components, alcohol consumption and obesity are associated with an increased breast cancer risk; thus lifestyle changes can lead to a lower risk of developing breast cancer. Surgical approaches, including bilateral risk-reduction mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy, are usually limited to women with a hereditary predisposition to development of breast cancer. The objective of this review is to summarize the various approaches directed at reducing the incidence of breast cancer.},

This technique shows a high sensitivity value of about 97.5\% and it offers many advantages over other imaging techniques to guide a biopsy: non-ionising radiation, low cost, full control of the needle in real time, accessibility in difficult locations, multidirectional punctures and excellent comfort for patients and radiologists. All of these advantages have made this technique the most widespread used to perform a biopsy for a suspicious breast lesion. The most important limitation is the failure to perform a biopsy for lesions that are not seen on ultrasound. An adequate radiological--pathological correlation is necessary to minimise the false-negative results. Ultrasound-guided CNB has proven to be a reliable technique for performing a biopsy for breast lesions that can be clearly seen on ultrasound.},

The authors tried to understand the scientific context and how previous findings paved Huggins way to his discoveries. With the help of summary or review articles on androgen deprivation therapy, the authors identified key publications and used his Nobel Prize speech as a basis to understand his discoveries. Furthermore, they used a recording of the laboratory-talk interview he gave about his findings to guide them to relevant publications. The authors found that the basis for Huggins' discoveries was the isolation of testosterone in 1935, not long before Huggins' 1941 hallmark publication. Huggins' work follows major experiments in the 19th century in orchiectomy done as a treatment for prostate hypertrophy. Researching the etiology of idiopathic hydrocele, Huggins analyzed the composition of prostate fluid. Further research led to the discovery of the influence of castration, testosterone, and estrogen on acid phosphatase. Recently developed methods facilitated the measurement of the phosphatases. He, therefore, had a biomarker for metastatic prostate cancer to measure treatment response. Very early on, he reported clinical improvements after castration in metastatic patients. Although the effect of orchiectomy on prostate hypertrophy was already known, Huggins was the first to show that testosterone stimulated and estrogen decreased the activity of prostate cancer. Huggins also established phosphatases as a tumor marker to measure disease response.            ,               Charles Huggins won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1966 for his discovery of the effect of castration on prostate cancer. The authors elucidate how he arrived at his findings and the contributions of prior researchers.},

Aulus Cornelius Celsus (25 BC-50 AD), a Roman encyclopedist, offered a still valid statement about inflammation: ``Notae vero inflammationis sunt quatuor: rubor et tumor cum calore and dolore'', defining the four cardinal signs of inflammation as redness and swelling with heat and pain. While inflammation has long been considered as a morbid phenomenon, John Hunter (18th century) and Elie Metchnikoff (19th century) understood that it was a natural and beneficial event that aims to address a sterile or an infectious insult. Many other famous scientists and some forgotten ones have identified the different cellular and molecular players, and deciphered the different mechanisms of inflammation. This review pays tribute to some of the giants who made major contributions, from Hippocrates to the late 19th and first half of the 20th century. We particularly address the discoveries related to phagocytes, diapedesis, chemotactism, and fever.

Due to increased screening, the majority of patients present with early-stage breast cancer. The Oxford Overview Analysis demonstrates that adjuvant hormonal therapy and polychemotherapy reduce the risk of recurrence and death from breast cancer. Adjuvant systemic therapy, however, has associated risks and it would be useful to be able to optimally select patients most likely to benefit. The purpose of adjuvant systemic therapy is to eradicate distant micrometastatic deposits. It is essential therefore to be able to estimate an individual patient's risk of harboring clinically silent micrometastatic disease using established prognostic factors. It is also beneficial to be able to select the optimal adjuvant therapy for an individual patient based on established predictive factors. It is standard practice to administer systemic therapy to all patients with lymph node-positive disease. However, there are clearly differences among node-positive women that may warrant a more aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore, there are many node-negative women who would also benefit from adjuvant systemic therapy. Prognostic factors therefore must be differentiated from predictive factors. A prognostic factor is any measurement available at the time of surgery that correlates with disease-free or overall survival in the absence of systemic adjuvant therapy and, as a result, is able to correlate with the natural history of the disease. In contrast, a predictive factor is any measurement associated with response to a given therapy. Some factors, such as hormone receptors and HER2/neu overexpression, are both prognostic and predictive.},

Numerous recent studies published outside the US have shown moderate to long-term pain relief and improvement of mobility after treatment with LDRT for joints affected by OA. Here, we review the most recent literature published on the use of LDRT in OA. We provide a brief outline on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, current treatments, and health care burden of OA within the US. We provide a brief history of the historic use of LDRT in the US as well as a history of LDRT within the modern era of radiation oncology, discuss criticisms of LDRT including recently published randomized trials questioning its benefit as well as the risk of secondary malignancy from LDRT, and provide an outline of treatment planning considerations and recommendations regarding dose and fractionation, energy, beam arrangements, and immobilization techniques. LDRT has been shown to be a cost-effective, noninvasive treatment with minimal side effects. Further investigation into the potential role in the treatment of OA with modern LDRT is recommended.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary Breast cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in women worldwide, with mortality rates largely driven by metastatic disease. Despite concerted efforts to uncover and target the mechanisms underlying these events, the five-year relative survival rate for metastatic breast cancer remains an abysmal 27\%. To better inform future directions for managing this disease, it is helpful to examine the evolution of cancer research, from foundational concepts to therapies and their pitfalls. This review aims to provide a rich overview of the history of breast cancer therapies spanning antiquity to the modern era, concluding with the rapid advancements in immunotherapies and our eventual progression towards personalized medicine. Abstract An examination of the origins of medical approaches to breast cancer marks this disease as one of the most difficult to manage. As the early identification, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer evolve, we will move to a time when each patient and their cancer can be assessed to determine unique patient-specific (personalized) approaches to therapy. Humans have attempted to manage breast cancer for millennia. Even today, the disease claims thousands of lives each year. In light of the increasingly sophisticated understanding of cancer diagnosis and treatment, together with our ultimate failure to offer a cure in the most difficult cases, it is instructive to reflect on the beginnings of our understanding.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: After breast-conserving surgery, radiotherapy reduces recurrence and breast cancer death, but it may do so more for some groups of women than for others. We describe the absolute magnitude of these reductions according to various prognostic and other patient characteristics, and relate the absolute reduction in 15-year risk of breast cancer death to the absolute reduction in 10-year recurrence risk. METHODS: We undertook a meta-analysis of individual patient data for 10,801 women in 17 randomised trials of radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery, 8337 of whom had pathologically confirmed node-negative (pN0) or node-positive (pN+) disease. FINDINGS: Overall, radiotherapy reduced the 10-year risk of any (ie, locoregional or distant) first recurrence from 35{$\cdot$}0\% to 19{$\cdot$}3\% (absolute reduction 15{$\cdot$}7\%, 95\% CI 13{$\cdot$}7-17{$\cdot$}7, 2p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}00001) and reduced the 15-year risk of breast cancer death from 25{$\cdot$}2\% to 21{$\cdot$}4\% (absolute reduction 3{$\cdot$}8\%, 1{$\cdot$}6-6{$\cdot$}0, 2p=0{$\cdot$}00005). In women with pN0 disease (n=7287), radiotherapy reduced these risks from 31{$\cdot$}0\% to 15{$\cdot$}6\% (absolute recurrence reduction 15{$\cdot$}4\%, 13{$\cdot$}2-17{$\cdot$}6, 2p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}00001) and from 20{$\cdot$}5\% to 17{$\cdot$}2\% (absolute mortality reduction 3{$\cdot$}3\%, 0{$\cdot$}8-5{$\cdot$}8, 2p=0{$\cdot$}005), respectively. In these women with pN0 disease, the absolute recurrence reduction varied according to age, grade, oestrogen-receptor status, tamoxifen use, and extent of surgery, and these characteristics were used to predict large ({$\geq$}20\%), intermediate (10-19\%), or lower ({$<$}10\%) absolute reductions in the 10-year recurrence risk. Absolute reductions in 15-year risk of breast cancer death in these three prediction categories were 7{$\cdot$}8\% (95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}1-12{$\cdot$}5), 1{$\cdot$}1\% (-2{$\cdot$}0 to 4{$\cdot$}2), and 0{$\cdot$}1\% (-7{$\cdot$}5 to 7{$\cdot$}7) respectively (trend in absolute mortality reduction 2p=0{$\cdot$}03). In the few women with pN+ disease (n=1050), radiotherapy reduced the 10-year recurrence risk from 63{$\cdot$}7\% to 42{$\cdot$}5\% (absolute reduction 21{$\cdot$}2\%, 95\% CI 14{$\cdot$}5-27{$\cdot$}9, 2p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}00001) and the 15-year risk of breast cancer death from 51{$\cdot$}3\% to 42{$\cdot$}8\% (absolute reduction 8{$\cdot$}5\%, 1{$\cdot$}8-15{$\cdot$}2, 2p=0{$\cdot$}01). Overall, about one breast cancer death was avoided by year 15 for every four recurrences avoided by year 10, and the mortality reduction did not differ significantly from this overall relationship in any of the three prediction categories for pN0 disease or for pN+ disease. INTERPRETATION: After breast-conserving surgery, radiotherapy to the conserved breast halves the rate at which the disease recurs and reduces the breast cancer death rate by about a sixth. These proportional benefits vary little between different groups of women. By contrast, the absolute benefits from radiotherapy vary substantially according to the characteristics of the patient and they can be predicted at the time when treatment decisions need to be made.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It is frequent for news items to lead to a short lived temporary increase in interest in a particular health related service, however it is rare for this to have a long lasting effect. In 2013, in the UK in particular, there has been unprecedented publicity in hereditary breast cancer, with Angelina Jolie's decision to have genetic testing for the BRCA1 gene and subsequently undergo risk reducing mastectomy (RRM), and a pre-release of the NICE guidelines on familial breast cancer in January and their final release on 26th June. The release of NICE guidelines created a lot of publicity over the potential for use of chemoprevention using tamoxifen or raloxifene. However, the longest lasting news story was the release of details of film actress Angelina Jolie's genetic test and surgery. METHODS: To assess the potential effects of the 'Angelina Jolie' effect, referral data specific to breast cancer family history was obtained from around the UK for the years 2012 and 2013. A consortium of over 30 breast cancer family history clinics that have contributed to two research studies on early breast surveillance were asked to participate as well as 10 genetics centres. Monthly referrals to each service were collated and increases from 2012 to 2013 assessed. RESULTS: Data from 12 family history clinics and 9 regional genetics services showed a rise in referrals from May 2013 onwards. Referrals were nearly 2.5 fold in June and July 2013 from 1,981 (2012) to 4,847 (2013) and remained at around two-fold to October 2013. Demand for BRCA1/2 testing almost doubled and there were also many more enquiries for risk reducing mastectomy. Internal review shows that there was no increase in inappropriate referrals. CONCLUSIONS: The Angelina Jolie effect has been long lasting and global, and appears to have increased referrals to centres appropriately.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 2,008) were randomly assigned to CMF plus placebo, CMF plus TAM, AC plus placebo, or AC plus TAM. Six cycles of CMF were given for 6 months; four cycles of AC were administered for 63 days. TAM was given daily for 5 years. Relapse-free survival (RFS), event-free survival (EFS), and survival (S) were determined by using life-table estimates. Tests for heterogeneity of outcome used log-rank statistics and Cox proportional hazards models to detect differences across all groups and according to chemotherapy and hormonal therapy status. RESULTS: No significant difference in RFS, EFS, or S was observed among the four groups through 5 years (P = .96, .8, and .8, respectively), for those aged {$\leq$} 49 years (P = .97, .5, and .9, respectively), or for those aged {$\geq$} 50 years (P = .7, .6, and .6, respectively). A comparison between all CMF- and all AC-treated patients demonstrated no significant differences in RFS (87\% at 5 years in both groups, P = .9), EFS (83\% and 82\%, P = .6), or S (89\% and 90\%, P = .4). There were no significant differences in RFS, EFS, or S between CMF and AC in patients aged {$\leq$} 49 or {$\geq$} 50 years. No significant difference in any outcome was observed when chemotherapy-treated patients who received placebo were compared with those given TAM. RFS in both groups was 87\% (P = .6), 87\% in patients aged {$\leq$} 49 (P = .9), and 88\% and 87\%, respectively (P = .4), in those aged {$\geq$} 50 years. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in the outcome of patients who received AC or CMF. TAM with either regimen resulted in no significant advantage over that achieved from chemotherapy alone.}

Despite this, more than 9 million people die from cancer every year. Therefore, we need to accept that our current cancer treatment paradigm is obsolete and must be changed. The new paradigm should reflect that cancer is a systemic disease, which affects an individual patient living in a particular social reality, rather than an invading organism or a mere cluster of mutated cells that need to be eradicated.

The nature and distribution of the immune cell subtypes in these tissues are reviewed to promote a better understanding of their important role in breast cancer prevention and treatment. We conducted a review of the literature to define the type, location, distribution, and role of immune cells in normal breast tissue and in in situ and invasive breast cancer. Immune cells in normal breast tissue are located predominantly within the epithelial component in breast ductal lobules. Immune cell subtypes representing innate immunity (NK, CD68+, and CD11c+ cells) and adaptive immunity (most commonly CD8+, but CD4+ and CD20+ as well) are present; CD8+ cells are the most common subtype and are primarily effector memory cells. Immune cells may recognize neoantigens and endogenous and exogenous ligands and may serve in chronic inflammation and immunosurveillance. Progression to breast cancer is characterized by increased immune cell infiltrates in tumor parenchyma and stroma, including CD4+ and CD8+ granzyme B+ cytotoxic T cells, B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in breast cancer may serve as prognostic indicators for response to chemotherapy and for survival. Experimental strategies of adoptive transfer of breast tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte may allow regression of metastatic breast cancer and encourage development of innovative T-cell strategies for the immunotherapy of breast cancer. In conclusion, immune cells in breast tissues play an important role throughout breast carcinogenesis. An understanding of these roles has important implications for the prevention and the treatment of breast cancer.},

Target definition is inextricably intertwined with the availability of target-specific therapeutic agents. Since 2005, the presence of HER2 on the cell surface has been used as an effective target for trastuzumab much as steroid hormone receptors are targets for endocrine therapies. An expert Panel reaffirmed the primary importance of determining endocrine responsiveness of the cancer as a first approach to selecting systemic therapy. Three categories were acknowledged: highly endocrine responsive, incompletely endocrine responsive and endocrine non-responsive. The Panel accepted HER2-positivity to assign trastuzumab, and noted that adjuvant trastuzumab has only been assessed together with chemotherapy. They largely endorsed previous definitions of risk categories. While recognizing the existence of several molecularly-based tools for risk stratification, the Panel preferred to recommend the use of high-quality standard histopathological assessment for both risk allocation and target identification. Chemotherapy, although largely lacking specific target information, is the only option in cases which are both endocrine receptor-negative and HER2-negative. Chemotherapy is conventionally given with or preceding trastuzumab for patients with HER2-positive disease, and may be used for patients with endocrine responsive disease in cases where the sufficiency of endocrine therapy alone is uncertain. Recommendations are provided not as specific therapy guidelines but rather as a general guidance emphasizing main principles for tailoring therapeutic choice.},

In general, systemic therapy recommendations follow the subtype classification. Thus, `Luminal A' disease generally requires only endocrine therapy, which also forms part of the treatment of the `Luminal B' subtype. Chemotherapy is considered indicated for most patients with `Luminal B', `Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positive', and `Triple negative (ductal)' disease, with the addition of trastuzumab in `HER2 positive' disease. Progress was also noted in defining better tolerated local therapies in selected cases without loss of efficacy, such as accelerated radiation therapy and the omission of axillary dissection under defined circumstances. Broad treatment recommendations are presented, recognizing that detailed treatment decisions need to consider disease extent, host factors, patient preferences, and social and economic constraints.},

  abstract = {Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a neoplastic proliferation of mammary ductal epithelial cells confined to the ductal-lobular system, and a non-obligate precursor of invasive disease. While there has been a significant increase in the diagnosis of DCIS in recent years due to uptake of mammography screening, there has been little change in the rate of invasive recurrence, indicating that a large proportion of patients diagnosed with DCIS will never develop invasive disease. The main issue for clinicians is how to reliably predict the prognosis of DCIS in order to individualize patient treatment, especially as treatment ranges from surveillance only, breast-conserving surgery only, to breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy and/or hormonal therapy, and mastectomy with or without radiotherapy. We conducted a semi-structured literature review to address the above issues relating to ``pure'' DCIS. Here we discuss the pathology of DCIS, risk factors for recurrence, biomarkers and molecular signatures, and disease management. Potential mechanisms of progression from DCIS to invasive cancer and problems faced by clinicians and pathologists in diagnosing and treating this disease are also discussed. Despite the tremendous research efforts to identify accurate risk stratification predictors of invasive recurrence and response to radiotherapy and endocrine therapy, to date there is no simple, well-validated marker or group of variables for risk estimation, particularly in the setting of adjuvant treatment after breast-conserving surgery. Thus, the standard of care to date remains breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy, with or without hormonal therapy. Emerging tools, such as pathologic or biologic markers, may soon change such practice. Our review also includes recent advances towards innovative treatment strategies, including targeted therapies, immune modulators, and vaccines.},

  abstract = {Inflammation is the mechanism of diseases caused by microbial, autoimmune, allergic, metabolic and physical insults that produce distinct types of inflammatory responses. This aetiologic view of inflammation informs its classification based on a cause-dependent mechanism as well as a cause-directed therapy and prevention. The genomic era ushered in a new understanding of inflammation by highlighting the cell's nucleus as the centre of the inflammatory response. Exogenous or endogenous inflammatory insults evoke genomic responses in immune and non-immune cells. These genomic responses depend on transcription factors, which switch on and off a myriad of inflammatory genes through their regulatory networks. We discuss the transcriptional paradigm of inflammation based on denying transcription factors' access to the nucleus. We present two approaches that control proinflammatory signalling to the nucleus. The first approach constitutes a novel intracellular protein therapy with bioengineered physiologic suppressors of cytokine signalling. The second approach entails control of proinflammatory transcriptional cascades by targeting nuclear transport with a cell-penetrating peptide that inhibits the expression of 23 out of the 26 mediators of inflammation along with the nine genes required for metabolic responses. We compare these emerging anti-inflammatory countermeasures to current therapies. The transcriptional paradigm of inflammation offers nucleocentric strategies for microbial, autoimmune, metabolic, physical and other types of inflammation afflicting millions of people worldwide.},

In two recent studies, low levels of social integration among older adults were related to higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, suggesting a possible biological link between social isolation and CHD. The current study examined relationships among social isolation, CRP, and 15-year CHD death in a community sample of US adults aged 40 years and older without a prior history of myocardial infarction. A nested case-cohort study was conducted from a parent cohort of community-dwelling adults from the southeastern New England region of the United States (N = 2,321) who were interviewed in 1989 and 1990. CRP levels were measured from stored sera provided by the nested case-cohort (n = 370), which included all cases of CHD death observed through 2005 (n = 48), and a random sample of non-cases. We found that the most socially isolated individuals had two-and-a-half times the odds of elevated CRP levels compared to the most socially integrated. In separate logistic regression models, both social isolation and CRP predicted later CHD death. The most socially isolated continued to have more than twice the odds of CHD death compared to the most socially integrated in a model adjusting for CRP and more traditional CHD risk factors. The current findings support social isolation as an independent risk factor of both high levels of CRP and CHD death in middle-aged adults without a prior history of myocardial infarction. Prospective study of inflammatory pathways related to social isolation and mortality are needed to fully delineate whether and how CRP or other inflammatory markers contribute to mechanisms linking social isolation to CVD health.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous studies of patients with breast cancer have examined age at diagnosis as a prognostic factor for survival with contradictory results. The current study examines the effect of age in conjunction with pathological tumour size, lymph node status and histological grade to clarify whether age at diagnosis is an independent factor for overall survival. Methods: This is a population-based study that examines the survival of 393 women with a first diagnosis of breast cancer in 1992 in the Greater Western region of Sydney in New South Wales, Australia. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Relative risks associated with age at diagnosis, pathological tumour size, and number of positive lymph nodes and histological grade and adjusted for each other were computed using Cox proportional hazard regression. Patients' ages were categorized as `younger' ({$<$}40 years of age at diagnosis), `middle-aged' (40-69 years) or `older age' ({$>$}69 years). Results: The 10-year survival of women {$<$}40 years was 49\%, which was significantly lower than `middle-aged' women (73\%). For women with node-negative breast cancer, younger women had a significantly (P = 0.011) poorer survival rate (68\%) than middle-aged (90\%) or older women (80\%). After adjusting for the effects of the pathological tumour size, the lymph node status and histological grade, women {$<$}40 years showed a higher risk of dying than older women. However, young women detected with a small ({$<$}20 mm) node-negative tumour have a good prognosis. Conclusions: Age at diagnosis, tumour size and lymph node status were independent prognostic indicators for survival. Age at diagnosis should be considered as an important factor in making decisions about adjuvant therapy, irrespective of nodal status.},

  abstract = {Purpose Despite interest from both radiation oncology residents and program directors, many residency training programs lack a formalized introductory curriculum to orient incoming radiation oncology residents to the specialty. Methods and Materials Using the 6-step model for medical education curriculum development, a structured introductory radiation oncology curriculum (IROC) was created for incoming post-graduate year 2 (PGY-2) radiation oncology residents to address foundational concepts including patient simulation, contouring, and plan evaluation. The curriculum was distributed to 55 training programs across the United States and Canada at the start of the 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020 academic years. Feasibility of curriculum dissemination was assessed via a survey of participating program directors. Curriculum effectiveness was assessed using an anonymous survey of participating residents administered pre- and postcurriculum and consisting of both subjective and objective knowledge-based questions. Results A total of 236 residents participated in IROC at the start of the 2018 to 2019 and 2019 to 2020 academic years. Of those, 228 of 236 (97\%) completed both the pre- and postcurriculum surveys. Of participating residents, the median residency program size was 10 (range, 2-28), and the median number of residents in each program per year was 3 (range, 1-7). At baseline, most PGY-2s (142 of 228, 62\%) reported being ``not at all'' or ``slightly'' prepared to function in the radiation oncology clinic, and after IROC most (188 of 228, 82\%) felt ``moderately,'' ``quite,'' or ``extremely'' prepared. Objective knowledge improved pre- to postcurriculum on a multiple-choice test from 70\% to 81\% (P {$<$} .0001) correct, with improvements observed across all question items. Program directors also reported that the curriculum was easier to use and more effective than prior orientation materials. Conclusions The implementation of an international introductory curriculum for PGY-2 radiation oncology residents is both feasible and effective. Similar strategies should be employed to enhance and standardize radiation oncology educational initiatives across training programs.},

  abstract = {Effective population-based mammography screening should impact breast cancer (BC) incidence, age and stage-specific incidence and BC mortality. We aim to investigate such effects in a time period of 10 years after implementation of the German mammography screening program. Data on 323,719 breast cancer patients from 2003 to 2014 for defined regions covering a population of 30 million inhabitants and official mortality data from 1998 to 2016 for almost the whole of Germany were used. We compared incidence and mortality rates for the prescreening time period (2003/2004) and the latest available data (2013/2014 and 2015/2016, respectively) and performed trend analyses using joinpoint regression models. In the screening exposed age groups (50--59 and 60--69 years), BC incidence showed a typical prevalence peak with the introduction of the mammography screening, mainly driven by an increase of early-stage BC. For Stage III and IV BC incidence in 2013/2014 was 24.2 and 23.0\% (age group 50--59 years) and 28.3 and 24.2\% (age group 60--69 years) lower than in the prescreening period. From 2003/2004 to 2015/2016 BC mortality decreased by 25.8 and 21.2\%, respectively. As corresponding trends in nonexposed age groups were distinctly unfavorable, the reduction of late-stage BC incidence and BC mortality in the screening exposed age groups in Germany is most likely to be attributed to the introduction of the national mammography screening program. These positive effects are bought at the cost of a moderate occurrence of overdiagnosis, especially by a sharp increase of in situ cancers.},

We estimated cumulative mortality and adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRR) associated with SNI. We adjusted for potential important confounders, including psychiatric and somatic status, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status. Cumulative 7-year mortality in men was 11\% for SNI 0/1 and 5.4\% for SNI 4 and in women 9.6\% for SNI 0/1 and 3.9\% for SNI 4. Adjusted MRRs comparing SNI 0/1 with SNI 4 were 1.7 (95\% CI: 1.1--2.6) among men and 1.6 (95\% CI: 0.83--2.9) among women. Having no partner was associated with an adjusted MRR of 1.5 (95\% CI: 1.2--2.1) for men and 1.7 (95\% CI: 1.2--2.4) for women. In conclusion, social isolation was associated with 60--70\% increased mortality. Having no partner was associated with highest MRR.},

  abstract = {Purpose To provide evidence-based recommendations to practicing oncologists, surgeons, and radiation therapy clinicians to update the 2005 clinical practice guideline on the use of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Methods The American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an Update Committee of experts in medical oncology, pathology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, guideline implementation, and advocacy. A systematic review of the literature was conducted from February 2004 to January 2013 in Medline. Guideline recommendations were based on the review of the evidence by Update Committee. Results This guideline update reflects changes in practice since the 2005 guideline. Nine randomized clinical trials (RCTs) met systematic review criteria for clinical questions 1 and 2; 13 cohort studies informed clinical question 3. Recommendations Women without sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases should not receive axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Women with one to two metastatic SLNs planning to undergo breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast radiotherapy should not undergo ALND (in most cases). Women with SLN metastases who will undergo mastectomy should be offered ALND. These three recommendation are based on RCTs. Women with operable breast cancer and multicentric tumors, with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) who will undergo mastectomy, who previously underwent breast and/or axillary surgery, or who received preoperative/neoadjuvant systemic therapy may be offered SNB. Women who have large or locally advanced invasive breast cancer (tumor size T3/T4), inflammatory breast cancer, or DCIS (when breast-conserving surgery is planned) or are pregnant should not undergo SNB. These recommendations are based on cohort studies and/or informal consensus. In some cases, updated evidence was insufficient to update previous recommendations.},

  abstract = {Most radiotherapy (RT) involves the use of high doses ({$>$}50\,Gy) to treat malignant disease. However, low to intermediate doses (approximately 3--50\,Gy) can provide effective control of a number of benign conditions, ranging from inflammatory/proliferative disorders (e.g. Dupuytren's disease, heterotopic ossification, keloid scarring, pigmented villonodular synovitis) to benign tumours (e.g. glomus tumours or juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas). Current use in UK RT departments is very variable. This review identifies those benign diseases for which RT provides good control of symptoms with, for the most part, minimal side effects. However, exposure to radiation has the potential to cause a radiation-induced cancer (RIC) many years after treatment. The evidence for the magnitude of this risk comes from many disparate sources and is constrained by the small number of long-term studies in relevant clinical cohorts. This review considers the types of evidence available, i.e. theoretical models, phantom studies, epidemiological studies, long-term follow-up of cancer patients and those treated for benign disease, although many of the latter data pertain to treatments that are no longer used. Informative studies are summarized and considered in relation to the potential for development of a RIC in a range of key tissues (skin, brain etc.). Overall, the evidence suggests that the risks of cancer following RT for benign disease for currently advised protocols are small, especially in older patients. However, the balance of risk vs benefit needs to be considered in younger adults and especially if RT is being considered in adolescents or children.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the neoplasm most diagnosed malignancy and the leading cause of mortality among women on a global scale. A profound increase in the understanding and clinical management of breast cancer has occurred over the past two decades, which has led to significant progress in prevention, early detection, and personalized breast cancer therapy. However, the biggest obstacle still faced in clinical practice is the complete understanding of intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity, in addition to the mechanisms of multiple drug resistance in the systemic treatment of the disease. In view of this, many studies focus on analyzing morphological and, mainly, molecular patterns of breast cancer, with the purpose of grouping these tumors into classes or entities to assist in clinical management, in the elaboration of epidemiological and functional studies, and in the performance of clinical trials. The most common special histological types of breast cancer include: medullary carcinoma, metaplastic carcinoma, apocrine carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, cribriform carcinoma, tubular carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, classic lobular carcinoma, and pleomorphic lobular carcinoma, in addition to the non-specific type of invasive ductal carcinoma, which constitutes the majority of newly diagnosed cases. As to their molecular aspect, intrinsic subtypes were identified based on global studies of gene expression profiles. Today, four molecular subgroups are widely reproduced and well established in the clinical routine, namely: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 +, and Triple Negative. Thus, the present article aims to briefly address the histological and molecular classification of breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease with multiple subtypes. The classification of these subtypes has evolved over the years. The most common and widely accepted classification of breast cancer is from an immunohistochemical perspective, based on the expression of the following hormone receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and human epidermal growth factor (HER2). Accordingly, the following four subtypes of breast cancer are widely recognized: luminal A, luminal B, HER2-positive, and triple-negative. With the recent advances in cancer research, and an increased molecular understanding of breast cancer, the current clinical model for classification of breast cancer may be benefit from the addition of several molecular markers such as miRNAs (let-7, miR-155, miR-150, miR-153) and mutations (p53, BRCA 1 and 2 genes). This chapter provides an overview of the characteristics of these four subtypes of breast cancer.},

This definition has become accepted widely by health care professionals and researchers in the pain field and adopted by several professional, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, including the World Health Organization. In recent years, some in the field have reasoned that advances in our understanding of pain warrant a re-evaluation of the definition and have proposed modifications. Therefore, in 2018, the IASP formed a 14-member, multinational Presidential Task Force comprising individuals with broad expertise in clinical and basic science related to pain to evaluate the current definition and accompanying note and recommend whether they should be retained or changed. This review provides a synopsis of the critical concepts, the analysis of comments from the IASP membership and public, and the committee's final recommendations for revisions to the definition and notes, which were discussed over a 2-year period. The task force ultimately recommended that the definition of pain be revised to ``An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage,'' and that the accompanying notes be updated to a bulleted list that included the etymology. The revised definition and notes were unanimously accepted by the IASP Council early this year.},

Thus, we estimated the degree of breast cancer risk reduction after surgery in women who carry these mutations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred eighty-three women with disease-associated germline BRCA1/2 mutations were studied for the occurrence of breast cancer. Cases were mutation carriers who underwent bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and who were followed prospectively from the time of their center ascertainment and their surgery, with analyses performed for both follow-up periods. Controls were BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with no history of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy matched to cases on gene, center, and year of birth. Both cases and controls were excluded for previous or concurrent diagnosis of breast cancer. Analyses were adjusted for duration of endogenous ovarian hormone exposure, including age at bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy if applicable. RESULTS: Breast cancer was diagnosed in two (1.9\%) of 105 women who had bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and in 184 (48.7\%) of 378 matched controls who did not have the procedure, with a mean follow-up of 6.4 years. Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy reduced the risk of breast cancer by approximately 95\% in women with prior or concurrent bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy and by approximately 90\% in women with intact ovaries. CONCLUSION: Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy reduces the risk of breast cancer in women with BRCA1/2 mutations by approximately 90\%.},

The cumulative incidences of ipsilateral invasive cancer, contralateral breast cancer, and death were estimated using competing risk methods.A total of 1286 DCIS patients who did not undergo locoregional therapy were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 60\,years (inter-quartile range = 51--74 years), with median follow-up of 5.5\,years (inter-quartile range = 2.3--10.6 years). Among patients with tumor grade I/II (n\,=\,547), the 10-year net risk of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer was 12.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 8.6\% to 17.1\%) compared with 17.6\% (95\% CI = 12.1\% to 25.2\%) among patients with tumor grade III (n\,=\,244) and 10.1\% (95\% CI = 7.4\% to 13.8\%) among patients with unknown grade (n\,=\,495). Among all patients, the 10-year cumulative incidences of ipsilateral invasive cancer, contralateral breast cancer, and all-cause mortality were 10.5\% (95\% CI = 8.5\% to 12.4\%), 3.9\% (95\% CI = 2.6\% to 5.2\%), and 24.1\% (95\% CI = 21.2\% to 26.9\%), respectively.Despite limited data, our findings suggest that DCIS patients without locoregional treatment have a limited risk of invasive progression. Although the cohort is not representative of the general population of patients diagnosed with DCIS, the findings suggest that there may be overtreatment, especially among older patients and patients with elevated comorbidities.},

Histologic grading needs to be performed accurately, on properly fixed specimens, and by adequately trained dedicated pathologists that take the time to diligently follow the protocol methodology. In this paper, we review the history of histologic grading, describe the basics of grading, review prognostic value and reproducibility issues, compare performance of grading to gene expression profiles, and discuss how to move forward to improve reproducibility of grading by training, feedback and artificial intelligence algorithms, and special stains to better recognize mitoses. We conclude that histologic grading, when adequately carried out, remains to be of important prognostic value in breast cancer patients.},

Currently, all DCIS lesions are treated, and treatment comprises either mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery supplemented with radiotherapy. However, most DCIS lesions remain indolent. Difficulty in discerning harmless lesions from potentially invasive ones can lead to overtreatment of this condition in many patients. To counter overtreatment and to transform clinical practice, a global, comprehensive and multidisciplinary collaboration is required. Here we review the incidence of DCIS, the perception of risk for developing invasive breast cancer, the current treatment options and the known molecular aspects of progression. Further research is needed to gain new insights for improved diagnosis and management of DCIS, and this is integrated in the PRECISION (PREvent ductal Carcinoma In Situ Invasive Overtreatment Now) initiative. This international effort will seek to determine which DCISs require treatment and prevent the consequences of overtreatment on the lives of many women affected by DCIS.},

We designed a questionnaire including 18 questions grouped in 3 main parts describing the profile of the participants, his/her own experience, and the current utilization of the SPOC. Of 1574 participants of the 2 first sessions, 182 (11.5\%) completed the questionnaire after 1~year. The majority of respondents were between the ages of 31 and 60 and belonged to a paramedical group (47.81\%). After 1~year, 84.6\% participants were satisfied or very satisfied with the content of the SPOC, 83.6\% would recommended it, and 67\% would be interested in using an updated SPOC again. Only 4.9\% kept some contacts with other participants and 4.9\% with teachers. 31.3\% considered that the SPOC had a medium impact on their professional activity, 33.5\% a lot, and 2.7\% completely whereas 24.7\% considered that it had little impact. The evaluation at 1~year showed that this digital learning method had a global positive impact on the professional practice of the participants. This study highlighted the empowerment of participants after this kind of teaching, but the network between participants was not enhanced.},

The challenge lies in distinguishing between non-progressive and progressive DCIS, often resulting in over- or under-treatment in many cases. With increasing screen-detected DCIS in these years, the nature of DCIS has aroused worldwide attention. A deeper understanding of the biological nature of DCIS and the molecular journey of the DCIS-IDC transition is crucial for more effective clinical management. Here, we reviewed the key signaling pathways in breast cancer that may contribute to DCIS initiation and progression. We also explored the molecular features of DCIS and IDC, shedding light on the progression of DCIS through both inherent changes within tumor cells and alterations in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, valuable research tools utilized in studying DCIS including preclinical models and newer advanced technologies such as single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and artificial intelligence, have been systematically summarized. Further, we thoroughly discussed the clinical advancements in DCIS and IDC, including prognostic biomarkers and clinical managements, with the aim of facilitating more personalized treatment strategies in the future. Research on DCIS has already yielded significant insights into breast carcinogenesis and will continue to pave the way for practical clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-obligate precursor of invasive ductal carcinoma~(IDC), whereby if left untreated, approximately 12\% of patients develop invasive disease. The current standard of care is surgical removal of the lesion, to prevent potential progression, and radiotherapy to reduce risk of recurrence. There is substantial overtreatment of DCIS patients, considering not all DCIS lesions progress to invasive disease. Hence, there is a critical imperative to better predict which DCIS lesions are destined for poor outcome and which are not, allowing for tailored treatment. Active surveillance is currently being trialed as an alternative management practice, but this approach relies on accurately identifying cases that are at low risk of progression to invasive disease. Two DCIS-specific genomic profiling assays that attempt to distinguish low and high-risk patients have emerged, but imperfections in risk stratification coupled with a high price tag warrant the continued search for more robust and accessible prognostic biomarkers. This search has largely turned researchers toward the tumor microenvironment. Recent evidence suggests that a spectrum of cell types within the DCIS microenvironment are genetically and phenotypically altered compared to normal tissue and play critical roles in disease progression. Uncovering the molecular mechanisms contributing to DCIS progression has provided optimism for the search for well-validated prognostic biomarkers that can accurately predict the risk for a patient developing IDC. The discovery of such markers would modernize DCIS management and allow tailored treatment plans. This review will summarize the current literature regarding DCIS diagnosis, treatment, and pathology.},

On the basis of their pivotal functions in cancer biology in general, each of the cellular processes represents promising single therapeutic targets. Further, due to their strong interconnection, targeting all of them in a multimodal approach could be another promising strategy to treat cancer. We, therefore, review the mechanisms of DNA damage induction, detection and repair as well as the induction of cell death. Further, features of senescence and mechanism of inflammation induction and abrogation are outlined. A special focus is set on how senescence and inflammation are related to diseases and how targeting them, could contribute to improvement of cancer therapies.},

  abstract = {Sentinel lymph node biopsy has become a standard staging tool in the surgical management of breast cancer. The positive impact of sentinel lymph node biopsy on postoperative negative outcomes in breast cancer patients, without compromising the oncological outcomes, is its major advantage. It has evolved over the last few decades and has proven its utility beyond early breast cancer. Its applicability and efficacy in patients with clinically positive axilla who have had a complete clinical response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is being aggressively evaluated at present. This article discusses how sentinel lymph node biopsy has evolved and is becoming a useful tool in new clinical scenarios of breast cancer management.},
